Thats science baby I think we have turned it around because the act of sending a first draft unfinished emotionally charged is a universally terrifying experience and I am willing to admit all the errors in my ways Interesting how management never ever has to admit when they are wrong If only there was a better way
summer  is gonna hit different

Happy birthday Mattison
hahahhahahahah why is there not an undo send option i feel like outlook has or had this
Just for the future
I wish they had that setting in the chess app
Happy birthday Matty
You can change settings to like have an email sit in your outbox for however long before sending
I EXPECT MY EMAIL TO REACH THEIR INBOX THE MICROSECOND I HIT SEND
Theyre literally waiting s to send it just in case you decide to back out
Its so funny how that works
unsend
Some have a resend option if it was within secs or a min
What emailer do u use
I committed the cardinal sin of accidentally hitting send instead of draft on a very emotionallycharged unedited email about scheduling issues to my new general manager New layer of hell I cant handle
thank you I am blessed to be in a group of so many capricorns and spoiled by all ur love
Happy birthday Matty
Happy beautiful birthday to our dearest Matty

Chicago coyotes are like cicadas they come and go in a  year long cycle
you must be in cahoots with the Quiznos Coyote
There never was no coyote and there certainly never was no coyote incident
No Never
Did anyone else hear about the coyote Quiznos incident
I cant believe I never knew there was a coyote in a Quiznos in 
Hahahaha
Huhneeded the captions
It was bizarre
He did great
Diego was handed the best possible audience he could have ever asked for
gay ass is also packed audience core such a good crowd
that show looks so fun is sully running that
Got exhausting to watch after a while
Like just justifying every shooting
And he was basically just a shooting apologist lol
I used to watch this dude on YouTube that was a former cop and he would do shooting breakdowns
Copcast
Its very Chicago
It was me a musician am artist who does the posters for the O Sees and a former cop who started a podcast
That show looks really cool
Actually pulling an audience
Dude is doing a talk show at a bar in Lincoln square
Huh
This Welcome to the Show thing is so cool
His profile says Drag Queen so its ok
Its because he does musical comedy
And its not because every single one of his jokes is homophobic
But I do not like him
Ive still never seen him
So no one has to follow him
Lmao they put Diego last in the lineup
Or rat race
What about spy kids
I wanna do this one but they wont let me
it depends on the day
Or does someone else name you
Do you guys name yourself
I havent seen it 
Kinda like this 
Trying to make some for internship
Theres this thing in sports social media where you put the logos of each time on a character
Can you guys think of any specific movie scenes that would be good for like a social media hockey post
to alienate anyone who didnt watch Very Cavallari
say you also volunteer at uncommon james
How do you guys binge drink so much
No I wish I worked at fabletics
Thats good info horby This is why you should be a bumble consultant
or minion for scale
i feel like you should make the sentence completely all caps or add in something a little more  like recently did a photo shoot with a minion
do you actually work at fabletics

My grandpa donate change the sheets
Ok fine then youre allowed to leave a shitty comment
My grandpa was a proud conservative beekeeper 
thats rly what he looks like
I reported them and instagram said those are actually fine
There have been some pretty bad ones telling me Ill get whats coming to me and sexual stuff etc
Theyre both like this is whats wrong with liberal men and actually beekeeping is for conservatives
But making fun of beekeeping is one step too far
But its funny how those two hobbies turn out to be the perfect discourse grenade
I love how these guys are probably the exact same guys who make fun of cancel culture
Idk what I was expecting youve committed the crime of being a woman on the internet
Yeah they dont hate each other as much as they hate me
I at least appreciate that there are defenders of beekeeping and mushroom growing in the IG comments
lol I didnt see the reel
Ive deleted some of the truly horrible ones
Oh its much worse on instagram

What time is best for me to eat ribs I just got delivered
anytime works for me the chive never sleeps
the highest engagement time  for instagram is noon on mondays
I have no idea i always try to google best time to post  and probably post at times that are better for branded recipe accounts
What time do u guys get most engagement for posting ur vids
Well the broncos got booty clapped by the bills as Im sure many of you were wondering
Couldnt get into it myself
The thumbs up is bc I dont want you guys yapping abt the show in here
Even the broncos player felt pretty bad about it after
Yeah that was a nasty hit man
I think that dude just got paralyzed
yes
I just caught up I need to chat
Should we have a traitors chat
Sean payton would have made a great Real Housewife in another universe tbh
Yeah Sean Payton kinda was pissing me off at first but he is elevating the shit out of this talent poor roster especially on offense He just has the players so well prepared Makes it easier to stomach when he gets all catty in the press
Its getting nasty now sorry my fault
Bills are averaging about  yards per rush though it feels like gotta clean that up
Hate ur coach love ur qb
But da broncos are legit
He refuse to lose honestly

Ooh sertas
Just wanna say when they mentioned the Denver Nuggets on chapo the other day that was huge for me
 wtf
a bit
of course
Power of nightmares
Forget the name but super insightful
Also the one where he highlights the similarities between the rise of the Taliban and the neocons is excellent
Ya hyper normalization is crazy good
Also shes been on chapo lol
It was so cool when Sarah canvassed for bernie with Eric Andre ngl
and we talked about hyper normalisation w her lol
one time my ex boy chat put sarah squirm in the chat when you could still do that on twitter
Only Curtis I dont care for is the one who never books me at laugh factory
Only Curtis I didnt care for so much was the Soviet footage with no narration Hey Adam ur supposed to tell me how to feel
Anyone trying to brutalist
Is there a move tn
Did you see he made a weyes blood music video lol
I put it on to get woke but whatever
Like hes such a good editor
trauma zone was sooo good not to be gay or whatever but as an editor it is really inspiring
Just watched the one about the mall in England
Im like  min into hyper realization but I put it on to fall asleep a lot
I was watching traumazone to fall asleep
okay but if were talking mark fisher the realll question is who are the adam curtis heads in the chat 
Yeah the beauty of capitalist realism is its so short
i like to pair my mark fisher with maggie nelson
thats def something to pick up when ur unemployed lol
I wanna read the big anthology of everything that was on k punk but its like  pages lol
Its so good
Ive got a library trip coming up and im gonna get this hot book yall are talking about
I just know he propped up verso books for a year with that purchase
when I worked at cards against humanity the guy who ran it who ended up getting canceled ordered hundreds of copies of capitalist realism to give everyone for christmas but he forgot so there were just like mountains of capitalist realism stacked by the front door for anyone to take lol
hes super good at articulating things in a clear way possibly the best reading his post punk book rn
thats fucking weird behavior im sorry
she wont book claire sundbye on lesbian lodge
like yes
Adult show and tell
they have this thing against me and theyve had it since college and wont book me for mainstage and its lowkey bullllllshit
cancelling all these shows and booking ur friends who arent comedians to do powerpoint nights is not the community forward thinking u think it is
Itd be like a full show not just the record
Million percent
I listened to a podcast on Hauntology and Lost Futures but after reading this I think the book has got to be better Hes explains zizeck so well its very impressive
Wait I hope you were serious lol
Just group messaged yall on insta I think they have a form to fill out I have just messaged them in the past
borkey is morally corrupt
wait i have a lot to say about lodge bookings but at work
im huge mark fisher girl
yes
Despite being literal gaming history
Oh Because Christian Borkey emailed Guinness and said the Pokmon reading didnt sell enough tickets
That guy was not legit sorry to break bad news
Not officially recognized at sloppies
Yeah its a lung capacity challenge more than anything else
Wait Im confused did you not already accomplish this goal at World Record sloppy Sunday
So im guessing its not PokeRap style cause you gotta go so fast
Yes Can you connect me
Bruceee you should totally do that at bricktown that would be electric
Oh yeah how could I ever forget
Wait Bruce how were you going to win the Lodge a Guinness world record
Yeah not worth it
Wed probably have to know a land lord tho to have access to that sort of thing
If only there were some sort of magical garage event space with some sort of multi functional heating AND cooling unit that could be sort of the new underground diy alt comedy space
Man that sucks Jeff
We cant have you burn down the theater with  presale and no Guinness book of world records
Watch them schedule AOC and Chicago method technique at the same time
Sorry Jeff Braun  I am sorry I know this is old news now but this makes me so mad at Christian Borkey and Lincoln Lodge generic idiocy and overall desire for standup hegemony Is there another generic standup show that she knows will make them tons of money waiting in the wings Hilarious to watch the series of emails evolve over the years
Im literally like I will rent a theater I will buy all the tickets myself
call it the chill as fuck show
Lodge has ignored all my emails about a show that would immortalize them in the Guinness book of world records
What if it was a hit though
You should show them how little you care Call your show Fuck You Comedy Show or something dumb like that
he speed reads  newspapers a morning and would quiz us on  them
And I talked to Kerry about it and she was like but if you sold out presale it would have been chill
I just remembered that when Sam cut that wire at AOC Kyle was like we cant have you guys burning down the theater with  presale tickets
Also presale is stupid Just base it on actual sales
They canceled my block party show bc low presales and I tried to reschedule it like x and theyve been ignoring me lol
Im sorry Jeff Braun  Lodge has been really weird lately about fun shows
I feel like people like him read a bunch of summaries of books
I was going to say I didnt know you interned at British community College
he has the vibe of someone who cant read but probably reads more than all of us combined
i would love to see him write a book
Lmaoooooo
"oh no this is the guy to be clear

I think stand up is disappointing because most thoughtful art being destroyed is because it passes through so many hands with different agendas
Sorry for being annoying
I understand the desire to consume things that let you turn your brain off but I wish there was more space for thoughtful art in the modern world  like across the board music books film included
Going to pour one out for Mark and David Graeber tn
RIP mark Fischer 
Probably explains why like crowd work comedians the bad ones are also becoming more popular
yeah he was really good i liked him
like interrupting me in the middle of speaking to be like uhmmm uhmmm yeah uhmmm this article was about uhmmm but like he had a point
Probably the most succinct and digestible piece of theory Ive ever read
and he made fun of how nervous i got when i talked
I just got it today and am ripping through it I think its excellent
hes the guy who introduced me to the people in the office as jewish
What was he like
Oh my god thats so sick
dude i interned for mark fischer in 
I think about my brother in law who likes Andrew Schulz and all that stuff and I guess theres some kind of wish fulfillment they get from watching that kind of comedy and maybe things that differ challenge them in a way they dislike I suppose its harder to relax when what youre consuming requires attention
I think the lodge is also maybe only interested in short term and less likely to take chances than it was years ago havent they been losing a lot more money in the last few years
Or to rephrase why is alt comedy maligned rn even when weve seen it has potential to succeed within the current system
Yeah I think it probably is but its being diluted
But as the audience for comedy as a whole grows larger youd imagine the appetite for alt comedy would grow even just as a consequence of the law of large numbers
And main stream viewers want to see stuff similar to stuff that introduced them into liking comedy which is largely right leaning unfunny podcasts
Its because comedy is becoming more mainstream
Bc I dont think people really like it
There is a proliferation of normcore standup happening and I really cant figure out the cause
So true
Two most successful Lodge cast members of the last like  years are Sarah Sherman and Megan Stalter and theyve created a space that wouldnt be accepting to either of them
Because the people who run these things think less of what they perceive as alt comedy
I feel like a lot of standup I see in nyc is homogenized
Idk why comedy as a whole has become so resistant to experimentation
Truly upsetting jokes aside that is annoying
Comedians You Should Know 
Should have named the show Chicago Hot Dog
Marry fuck Tony
Man this fucking blows sorry Jeff Braun
What if you changed the name to koll tiny
Beg for one more chance and let me buy every presale ticket for February
Its on my list
Chicago method technique that WILL get you LAID
Thatll catch some eyes
What about the free money Chicago method technique
Have you considered calling it roast battle
Maybe Hillarious and a picture of Rodham Clinton in there somewhere
Christmas we share
If I find a spade You get custody on fridays I get saturdays
Chicago method technique hilarious
Maybe throw a hilarious in the title
I have an awesome projector and am searching for smallmedium rooms in spaces that are hungry for alt comedy
It kind of kills the point of a theater of independently produced show if you want everything to basically be branded the same as the laugh factory
The ironic part is the room was packed last night with walk ups and comps
reply with actually friday works for me and my show Only Fomedy actually
Send him this with dollar signs and question marks
Maybe see what she thinks about this
Your art and show name is driving away the kill Tony demographic
post this as a promo
So stupid
That kinda art attracts the right crowd for that kinda show
What a little bitch
Oh my god

adrienne youve done such a good job

Also people underestimate bachelorbachelorette because they dont realize thats also a highly strategic social game
They always think theyre smarter than they are
Anyway big brother players are sub par
Once Lisa Barlow is on traitors its going to win an Emmy
I feel like this was said earlier in chat
and it was
Henrys gotta take a break for that one
I was just stanning my girl dorinda
I knew better
see
Well I didnt know about this
The traitors picked the obvious choice and Carolyn was saying it from the start
The Dorinda choice was a bad one
Ultimate respect 
Dorinda could drink me under the table
I spit
When she was like ohhh theyre sorry for getting less money just to make us more of a target
THE HOUSEWIVES ARE SOOOOOO DUMB
Dorinda aside
Dorinda ruled
Keep Dorindas name out of your mouth
I said wouldnt it be hilarious
Henry told dmed me on the side and asked me to say that
I bet Robyn turns it up if she doesnt get murdered immediately
Its gonna make me question why you left your job at the haberdashery
Its so funny
Its really wild how dumd so many of the housewives are
Hey brother if your not cumming in caps
Tonya is the best anti hero though
Tonka should be in Florida with his family
Bob the Drag Queen is my favorite this season
Yeah I was kidding
wait that was good
It scared me
I dont know why cumming was in caps
take away the emphasis I remove my like
I love Alan CUMMIMG
He made Tonya give up Tonka
On Alan cumming
Youre making Joey say slurs
Just give Alan his flowers
Henry theres no point in doubling down
Stolen valor
I think Alan Cumming is getting credit for his outfits that I think the production team is designing
anyways Im off to the lincoln lodge
Henrys not homophobic he just hates faggots
Ho Mo Phauxbic could be a good drag name
Excited to see her reaction
Gabby might find the smoking gun next episode
Sounding more homophobic by the minute
Yeah homophobes dont make sense
heres what i love gabby windey being the literal bachelorette and now not only being a lesbian but also seriously dating a standup comedian i find her perfect  i hope she wins
Yes
I dont think thats fair I think bob the drag queen is the best character on the show
Australia season two was terrible
And yes I HAVE seen the international versions
Alan Cumming is being so cunty and gay and not liking that is homophobic
mitchies there  he made it sound star studded
shut the fuck uppppppo

Cmon
This something or other is iconic
Andrea maybe
You cant call her iconic if you idk her
Yeah but I bet everyone in the uk does
Alan is pushing too hard
You dont even know her name
Idk the UK woman but I can tell shes an icon
But youre just plain wrong here unfortunately
I appreciate you sticking up for the below the line hosts of the international seasons
And he was good in spy kids
The Alan cumming role being iconic is erasure for the other international seasons that came before US and I wont stand for it
And so many people biffed it
They had to run across floating platforms late in the game
And that was redeeming
Jesus Christ never come to my workshop again
Like pure laughter
Season two though he was laughing so hard during one of the challenges
Sorry youre wrong
Wrong
I also think Alan cumming is annoying
i wanna be alan

this is zac efrons brother erasure
I bet they do on YouTube
Someone should make a cut that excluded any mention of who is a traitor
I feel like voting him out or murdering him is just a waste of time so he will go far
Too much exposition
Truly the most secure spot as a player
Honestly a great place to be for n
Chrishell from selling sunset has ROASTED him a few times already
I think hes taken the role of too dumb to be a traitor but too unlikeable to strategize with
Its awesome that hes famous
Hes one of the dumbest people on the planet
I need him to last till the end
Sandoval is the best of us
Sandoval and Britney Spears weird ex
Have to say that the straight white guy delegation did not send their best this season
""
Just to piss us off maybe
Why hide that from the viewer
I feel like they would have said that in the rules
Im guessing they werent allowed to say which number of doors from the left they were
Yo the way theyre playing the door game is pissing me off
Tell her to send me pics anytime her dog shits
Give her my number
Did dog eat a burger
It looks like a burger patty
Hahahahahahahaha
my mom sending me pics of my  year old dogs diahreaheh
the eyes are so weird looking and the skin is too smooth
why do they have a weird ai filter on all the confessionals
SHE LOVES TOO HARD
Im a huge Ayan fan
The monster is throwing the shoe not shoe at monster
Sort of a reverse alZaidi situation Im afraid
Who is he Muntadhar alZaidi
Was it with Kayley Horton
Caroline
Hes not even funny
And the faithful really fuck over someone at the end imo
But also season  is kind of bad the traitors make enormous mistakes
She has the street smarts of a career addict not to be brushed aside
She gets bullied by the nuero typical
Same thing happened to her in survivor
But shes high intelligent
Everyone underestimates Carolyn
I agree
""
""
Which season
Absolute idiots
Huge mistake
Ok yup it was who I thought
Wait sorry I dont know yet
Need to talk bout dis
First murder was a mistake
Joe Kilgallon cheated on his wife then got really drunk and threw a shoe at lodge and they gave him a gazzelie for it
Just wondering why you didnt change it
Traitors rocks
Need a daily summary
Can I get the short and dirty of it all
The chat going crazy today what is going on
Why are we all harping on this
So its like
I already spelled it sow
Im trying to teach Andrew to respect women
Ok thats kind of what I thought ty
Kerry covered that with her joke I think
Sorry
Isnt it spelled sew
You guys could hit a couple open mics together or whatever
No I got my lovely gf a sowing machine for Christmas and she is also learning to sow
Klinger my fist will give you a free alteration to your Face if you try to do that
hit you up you mean ask for free alterations 
who are you going to hit up about reaping
Matty Merritt Im going to hit you up about sowing later
Theres no set johnversation volume bc any johnversation will expand to fill up any room or container its confined to
But thats neither here nor there
Not a normal johnversation volume
Which is like a normal conversation volume
Honestly Ive been blasting music in there and the loudest it gets outside is like  decibels
You cant even tell its the ac thumping on the roof when it starts spinning up
How sound proof is ur garage
I got it to heat the garage and wouldnt you know its too cold for it to heat the garage
look at this puppy
INSTALLING
Youre just taking away the crucial part of stand up
Or a monologue or a play
Well they have these its called a one person show
how did we know this info from the gazelllies do we have someone representing us from the inside
were holding vouch up my ass hop in
I heard the crushes auditions are at laugh factory this year
SORRY LAUGH FACTORY
gonna start a rumor the netflix auditions are happening at crushes
I think so
Not when theres real housewives to watch
cant wait to hear about the trip
Both of those guys are way more talented and better than Ill ever be but i just cant get into their comedy at all for that reason
is this the netflix is a joke thing
Jerrod is one of my favorites The perfect amount of self indulgent
I think drew michaels and Jerrod Carmichael too self indulgent on stage but not untalented
also im post covid comedy
I think it would make better lineups than cysk
"like why would
i know that guy"
well i think the whole thing is im a gen z girl
i feel like i just learned about the concept of absolutely not liking someone and liking their stand up
Make a new cysk called comedians Kristi has heard about
I think I would love his standup if he was like  percent less up his own ass
No way to know unfortunately John was fixing his ac
Im back in town Did I win a Gazzellie
He did a residency at the lodge a couple years ago and I kinda liked him despite all of the bad things Ive heard
Speaks to his talent that he is successful when it is incredibly rare to meet a comedian that doesnt hate him
Not to be a contrarian drew michael type but i like drew michaels standup
And then they make it and its like oh yeah standup looks insane when theres no one laughing
Theyre like why is no one doing this
All Im sayin is that someone has the idea to film a standup special w no audience every five years or so
the joke was about killing myself
I took Kevin bozemans class in  and he came to give feedback and he liked one of my jokes
 sorry
Five words for you buddy
Cameron Gillette has more info
I remember when the HBO one came out he was on You Made it Weird I was a different guy then and Pete being so impressed and talking about how good the suicide joke was that it never had a punchline haha
Every story Ive heard of him is so incredibly mean lmao Cam is in love with him though
The thoughts do start get weird after a while though hes not wrong
When I moved to New York I told my landlord I was a comedian and she was like Drew Michael lived here before you
I like his Comedy Central half hour quite a bit but I absolutely hate those HBO special so much
Hed hate that someone is asking that so much
Hes the guy we would be talking about if this groupchat were set in 
Maria bamford did it better
Lmao
who drew michael
Lol was this entire special in front of noone
Kilgallon got into fight with Drew Michael so I actually take back everything I said
God Drew Michael once showed up at wet cash and did like  after the booked headliner
""
Why
Also Drew Michael tried to sue them so thats probably why
Danny is a good guy leave him out of this
Haha I can see Dan Kallas address on the trademark registration
cant wait to go home and watch the hangover with danny tonight
dont show up to CYSK tomorrow
haHAHAHA
Im gonna get hammered at lodge tonight and tell people that theyll never do AoC
"thats actually really good 
she says matter of factly as if granting you permission on behalf of her gender to entertain your little idea"
It would piss off Dan kallis so much
Hahahaha that would actually be so funny funny to do this
Tbh I think youll hate it
Jokers you should know
JYSK AUDITION SHOW AT THE GARAGE FOR AoC
Crushes audition show
may the fours be with you 
Yeahyeah thats sounds about right
Opened with rape jokes
omg what did he say
But outside of that I heard it was a good time
I stg the shit yall read
And guess what  he said a bunch of evil things and upset everyone
Also  the drama from the gazelles last night was that they had known monster Junior Stopka close it out
PreCOVID CYSK was unreal
No more AC installs
I am reliable I promise Ill get my act together
its awesome
awesome development at work my coworker broke up with his  year relationship and keeps asking to hold my hand
I dream of another show hosting huge auditions like that
Thanks manI needed this 
Precovid it was the hottest comedy room Id ever seen All the audition shows I did were like doing standup on easy mode
Scared the cats
Man this got a big laugh out of me
Its amazing
It seems like it was a really cool show
hahahaahahahahaha
At that point you gotta introduce him as JoeDaComic
They had a run where they were the coolest show when bar shows were the coolest thing and everything wasnt at  clubs and i like the show because im old and sentimental about it but its funny when they expect new comics to care when its as hit or miss as its been
and then chris trani was next in the lineup and i gotta say absolutely delightful
and then wouldnt really respond back to me
he was mad i didnt know him and asked his last name
he was really rude to me hosting laugh factory
Damn thats rough
Hahahahahaha
yeah we heard
Cysk was comically bad when I did it Everyone ate shit until I went up and yeah I cooked
Kristi and Joey please do this for chrushes but to people at cafe mustache
So funny to be in your s and have three kids and then yell at some  year old open micer that they wont do your bar show
In which case uh oh
Unless people like it here
Nooooooo not currently great show CYSK
My favorite part of that lodge story is that he walked up to random tables and told the people sitting at them that theyd never do CYSK
Yeah hes an asshole
Hes being a real shit head i would say
He got scary yelling at kayley to shut the fuck up at lodge
Hey guys I was away from the chat for a sec were all still fans of my favorite standup Joe Kilgallon right
oh shit is that a good book i just found her wild ig
He has wild entitlement
Thats what I learned from reading All Fours
Meanwhile its almost always ok for a woman to have an affair
Just doing standup comedy alone gives her the right to he cruel to him
He has three kids with his wife who is a nurse
Esp with a kid due at the time Jesus christ
Hes the piece of shit
No shade to Kayley the guy is a grown ass man and should know better imo
No judgement on her regardless of whats happening
probably
Theres an online test called is my wife mean enough for me to cheat on her
If not true I feel bad for Kayley she could just be collateral damage
They call it the comedy vault because thats where the best scene secrets are stored
Its okay to cheat on your wife but only if shes mean enough
What happens at Zanies Rosemont stays at Zanies Rosemont
But Im very good at making inferences
And I trust my sources
Someone saw him and his affair partner making out in the burbs
Or like Im reading between the lines of Kayley Hortons standup and his podcast
He wouldnt stop pressing for it
I can always count on you two to ingest all the local content
Ive heard that its been confirmed
Just got A flashback when my mom died I told my rabbi I was too sad to do comedy and he kept insisting I host a roast of him
Yes It was covered on his and Jonahs podcast real heads know
I just seemed likely
Was cheating on his wife certified gossip
I heard he was complaining about his wife being mean to him and its like  I wonder why
Good to know Im having a better time in New York than he is in Chicago lol
But here we are
Never thought I would have more respect for him as a comic than as a man
Has a daughter cheats on his wife gets banned from the Lincoln Lodge trying to speed run getting blacklisted
Dude the Joe Kilgallon arch this year has been unparalleled
People love awards season
Im looking at the pictures and Im like wait why was everyone there
I wasnt there but i had people on the inside
Wait I just noticed the shoe in the picture
Yes
Is that what his award was for
I for one wouldnt be celebrating getting so drunk at lodge that I threw my shoe at the window two weeks after my wife just gave birth but I guess thats just me
this line is a nod to the famous chat crossword
the first verse is about being a landlord

Meredith rocks
YOU ARE DISGUSTING
YOU ARE VILE
Hahahahaha that ruled
The freak out about recording in the sprinter van which is already being recorded anyways 
Keep logan weird 
ohhh my god i just saw some guy eat shit on a lime scooter at the intersection of belden and st louis 
they were like wuuuut the fuck
i did see them go to milwaukee that was awesome
The salt lake housewives always bring their a game
She also gets Bat Mizvahd this season
waiiiit chrishell on traitors is awesome too
i love meredith
ok making it a point to catch up this weekend
Yes
wait r u talking about salt lake
So very excited to see Dorinda
Shes been plowing through rh nyc
It was absolutely electric
I watched the end of this episode with Maggie its nuts
Tom Sandoval is providing so many laughs on accident this season
Meredith accused one of the girls of bugging her room
Which is the mark of a great season
Been screaming at our tv more than usual
Ive been loving this season
I would say you dont have to but you really should bc it is really fun
and alienating people who havent seen it 
i love going to a party and finding someone else talking about a reality show 
something to look forward to 
i have really fallen off salt lake this season
You dont need any background at all very fun for  people who arent even into reality tv
I love the thrill of watching a weekly reality tv show it still does it for me
i fear i am gonna get into traitors this season too maddie
also gabby windy
Wow Tom Sandoval and Dorinda and a random old Mountbatten ass royal on the traitors apparently is it the kind of thing where you need to have watched before to appreciate it
I think Joey is going Tuesday and Lucia and I talked about going Thursday
They are a different breed
Thats true
The average American mind cannot handle meeting a real housewife in person
I didnt like having the civilians in the American traitors because they were just way too trusting
The British version does civilians which i do think is more compelling but less entertaining in a way
This one has a lot of fun survivor players too
I know Adrienne Stout is into it lots of housewives
Absolutely love that show
Gibbs start tonight
Havent seen the new season but as someone who doesnt care for reality tv too much this is as good as it gets for me
Ya its basically just mafia but everyone is like a v good reality tv person
Wait this is like if Among Us was a TV show
I do still have a ticket for Sunday afternoon if you or anyone wants
I actually had to switch to today Its intermission rn
Is anyone watching the traitors new season just premiered it rules
Is it just me or is Cindy kind of BAD
cindy you are BAD

Itd be so funny if I go through all this and my garage just burns down
Im messing with propane heaters still
its effective heating range is like  to 
IM SO ANNOYED
THE MINI SPLIT DOESNT HEAT VERY WELL IN VERY COLD TEMPERATURES
Think of how many high powered business deals can happen in that span of time
Thats ten New York minutes though
Yet some people cant be bothered to pay the fare smh
Its crazy like maybe a train will be  minutes late but thats it and people just lose it haha
Yeah dude the MTA runs like a machine People in New York were always shocked when I would be like you have no idea how great this is
People in nyc love to complain about the trains and its like lol you mfers have never waited  min for the western blue line in the dead of winter
Im seeing him at schubas in the wild for the first time ever
Werent him and zako like fighting or something
What was the drama with Greg bartusiak a while ago
I thought someone recited Ians poop fucker joke too close to a dry tree and the joke was too fire
Damn that was the last gazellies too
Im gonna do this I think
At least you supported them financially
You can have a best tenant award
Hahahahahahahaha
IM SO SORRY
You gotta host the johnzellies in the garage
I was counting on you to livestream them
Im going to schubas
I WAS INSTALLING MY AC
FUUUUUCK
Hahahahahahahaha
I missed them
Hahahahahahaha wait the Gazellies are definitely over
I think its maybe just a good reflection of the effects of prolonged lack of investment of resources in infrastructure and public goods combined with climate change stuff
Lol Im running late
I want Gazellies updates
I dont personally understand how there are so many different separate fires at the same time in separate spots like are they all connected or if it is that easy of phenomenon right now due to the Santa Ana wings so it is truly happening everywhere with big vegetation
My brother said the same thing that they think the winds were strong enough to blow transformer and spread the spark Also there had been two years of wet winters creating an abundance of growth that was all super dry at this point from  month drought Transformers blew in my brothers area so they are still without power but no fire
Wait until theyre over and then pop off I think
It is funny but maybe
Yeah my brother lives in North Hollywood and says the winds are insane I think at some point the air gets so hot that any existing fire spreads super easily
makes sense its so so scary
But Im assuming events like that are springing up all over and the winds are just spreading to too fast
Is it insensitive to make a video where I show how tired I am after sucking all the LA firefighters dicks
And oxygenating them
And the wind has been blowing the fire to a ton of other places
And the sparks caused a fire bc everything is so dry
A friend who lives in Santa monica said winds ripped part of a roof off a building and hit a transformer or something
I think in some places up to mph
And there have been lots of winds gusting all over
Not sure of the exact cause but it is so unbelievably dry out there
is it like wind and heat combo
ok my dumb question is im confused how the fires are starting
" Pennsylvania Ave NW
Washington DC "

i feel like aria and caleb need to just be straight up about having some feelings for each other jr probably microcheated on his ex wife before she cheated based on how down bad he is for everyone but zania nick is a manchild and should be on lithium but sandy is literally  years younger so maybe they can be on lithium together and scotty is a big no
has anyone else watched the most recent season of the ultimatum
ill lyk in an hour lmao
oh for sure
Or rather I think there was enough writing on the wall with the election that youd have to be truly insane to say something really stupid without thinking about it
Unfortunately I feel like there will be enough hollow brained open micers who will think the the fires are abstract enough to be on the table
tbh the night after trump won nobody said anything bad hoping for the best

Really pretty sunset if you can snag a view right now
Lets do an interview anyway and see if youre a good fit 
idk if I can take on another stayathome life partner at this time 
Joey if you get an interview with john i can be a reference
and so joey is sort of the no nonsense brass tacks sort of fellow while john is always making random additions to the property and mucking things up with his goofiest newest invention
well john could pay joey minimum wage he needs to pay rent and stuff but john could still turn a profit while doing less work
Could make money on that I assume
id watch that
Joey and John as this generations odd couple would be a lot of fun
Joey would you want to manage Johns property for him

I did see a maybe stupid LinkedIn hack so that you can see jobs that were posted like  minutes ago so you can apply early Idk if that is helpful at all
God bless you
I cant believe you didnt quit the day after trump got elected and your boss was singing three little birds to the whole office
I sincerely wish they had just fired me
Im sorry Joey
I cuss out the very nature of this company once a day and thats with a very minimal workload
Im not about to start working hard for this company
my manager quit at Same Day
Did this happen at same day
Why does this keep happening to you
he has seniority over me and they just kind of expect me to take on all the work load Mr Hanley will learn to regret which of the customer service fellas they fired
theyre firing my coworker tomorrow which is such bullshit that I wont be coming into the office again and am looking for a new job asap

I look for groups of things that really to each other and then pretty quickly realize that there is usually another thing that could fit into that group so then I stash that for later and look for a different group and when I confidently have two clear groups I make the first guess etc
Hahahahahaha I truly thought it was obvious I would never use a weird photo of myself with the word accepted above my head
I dont get why people fell for it Sam is too cool to do something lame like that
 year olds only do that when theyre really scared
dude I hate seeing my friends apply to grad school
sams has a concussion every  weeks how would he have the time to apply to iowa
it genuinely pissed me off how many people thought it was real
No Sam got in I thought

this is crazy

While you dawdled with sudoku I was expanding my glutes 

While you pondered the crossword I carved my calves

So I start looking for connections that use those words in different ways
Im living vicariously through my friends solving the connections puzzle
Like this one from November Im like too many of these are making me think of Mario which makes me think its NOT that
These are all things that remind me of my estranged father
This is easy
Usually try to find three things that would obviously be connected and then try to find the more obscure fourth choice

What this is
its lit
and ask them questions about this shit
I found out I can just do the property tax appeal through them
Also I pay like  a month for a benefit with my work that basically gives me legal representation for free
these fuckers have no idea what theyre dealing with
Im a prophet

ask her to do a shot with you
did you hit that oil
Getting my oil sample at coatco
Some of them are listed as having an unfinished basement and then simultaneously have a basement apartment listed on like apartmentscom
ur single handedly taking down fishman i like it
And its not like these are some down on their luck elderly people who arent making good money anymore These are all multiunit buildings without seniorexclusions that arent listed as having a garage or a finished basement when all of them do
not all of it but some obvi
 a month thats my BEER money
these people have too much money on their hands
thats actually good can u get some of my neighbors on the other side of kimball i just got strong armed into signing up for composting
fuck you youre gonna be a good neighbor
Honestly exactly
in a way youre forcing community
So Im basically paying more than some of my neighbors when by all appearances they should really be paying much more
Yes exactly
oh and like others pay more
So if a property is assessed at a lower value than another property they pay less in taxes
Every township in chicago is basically given a chunk of the city budget that their taxes are responsible for paying Each individual property in that township is then assessed at a specific value to determine the individual amount for which that property is responsible to pay which is their property tax
i just genuinely am curious
no shade
like narcing on ur neighbors
wait but actually what do you get out of it haha
its absurd
They just get to pay less in taxes
if they dont report to the system that theyve added a garage or finished the basement theres no repercussions
Hes literally raising the rents on other landlords
and it relies on property owners self reporting when there are changes in the characteristics of the properties
Hes a landlords landlord
Like they use an automated data model to estimate the value of all the properties
In all genuineness its kindof bullshit how the property tax system is setup
Just when we thought you couldnt get any more likeable
blood will flow in the streets
Im declaring war on Logan Square
Currently working on finding out how to submit property characteristic errors to the assessors office so my neighbors pay more in taxes

Can I do a bit where I kill myself by leaving the car running with a garden hose
I HAVE VACUUMED UP ANY AND ALL DUST IT DOES NOT EXIST IN THIS SPACE
My only thought is maybe did we consider the dust
The brick wall looks great
I did some estimating and it seats about 
Garage is pretty much good to go baby
My shift was lowkey not goated
til theyre done
i guess dont tell people the ideas u care about
like its def been done before but yeah it feels too close to home and weird timing
of someone else to do it first
yeah thats a unique idea and definitely not cool
That sucks tho Im sorry
Sounds like she just had some smoke and mirrors deflection move
i like did in a way yeah idk i feel weird and annoyed
its like too late now but normal to be seething
oh yeah i think u should have said something then
and i was like hey and she said that weird thing about how its different
like  weeks ago
idk i guess drag queens are just used to stealing ideas tho lol
when did you find out
i feel like its tooo late like shes doing it tonight and probs rented the uhaul already
like why not
i think u should actually tell her its not cool with you
this is worse than immediately after i started comedy every single comedian started joking about dating
Jk not drama just undeniable inspiration I feel like But also anything goes I spose
truthfully im gonna be a bit annoyed bc i feel like im gonna see like  insta stories being like neutral gena is a genius
Thats like real housewives style comedienne drama
I think thats pretty crazy
and i was like 
and she was like no what im doing is marketing what ur doing is art
Roadkill presents labyrinth
she like told me in the office shes doing it and i was like woah whered u get that idea
im having a headliner in westys
Or see if u can find a place with a bunch of storage lockers and set up diff comics in them
You should drive the you haul to a storage locker and have the headliner in there
i was like gonna film my special in summer and have her open for me
I had an idea recently for road kill
anyway you all are invited to my show in a the moving guys truck
Yeah thats a little too close to home if u ask me
i would ask her
idk im not the first one to do a show in a uhaul
i mean ive had the roadkill idea for like two years almost at this point and have been talking to her about it forever
its like theyre doing a grand entrance in a uhaul
Id feel weird Is the show happening in the uhaul and have they ever talked about it before
i dont own the idea but i guess shes like going around the office saying she thought of it before me
should i feel weird that netural gena is like renting a uhaul for her show tn at boots
thats a really good one
more road head and go worldwide

I deserved it though I was on my way to Second City
some kids did that to me on the bus a couple years ago

Are you kidding me
I will HAPPILY bite another man
thats how you reeeeaaallly get em
Its all about biting
But I was sitting down too pretty stuck
Hmm Id think twice maybe
Id say at least
Or bigger
Was he John sized
Id kick a dude in the face like a horse
I was facing forward in a seat and he came from behind I didnt know it was happening or else I would have But he was huge Im not fucking around with that
Like a fucking donkey
Id start kicking so fast
Honestly so many people feel obligated to use their hands in a fight but buddy on a bus your hands are for elevated your legs to kick people in the face
Let me be the first to say happy new year
Hahahahahaha
I was listening to ABBA
No he got off and when I left I went to the bus driver and was like I dont know if this matters but a guy punched me Ok have a good day
Hahahaha imagining you on the phone on the bus just immediately after getting punched calling the cops and explaining the situation while making eye contact is really funny
Did you call the cops or anything
Hahahahaha
And you know what Selfishly I wish he stayed in
He was big and just got out of jail which he yelled
Gotta be the bus alpha
Bus Beta
It would be funny if you and me went clubbing
And can I say Cheugy
Some guy starting yelling about someone touching women and I was in a single seat with no one in front of me and then he punched me

It only hit me later like oh I should have said something
when im crying at work the last thing i want is someone to ask me if im ok personally

all the comments are i have also been told to quit or who sent this
Also jumping into say Mike brought me to a Wisconsin gig to bully me lol

Looking forward to seeing this develop
So far I know Bob Keens personal axis of evil includes Mike OKeefe and the Coles managers
i wish i dated more creeps when i was  could have been so awesome
Now he seems awesome
without a doubt
He wants to be the guy to date  year olds
Honestly thats probably why OKeefe sent that 
i hate that
TJ has been nothing but nice to me personally but every time Ive had a conversation with him  he opens with so Im dating a couple of  year olds
Bob keen going there
the algorithm is aware
lmao
that being said TJ has been on are we dating the same guy in a major way
Ive barely interacted with him but heard a half dozen stories about him assaulting someone
i wasnt really around for the okeeefe era but it seemed crazy
Many such cases
Just bottled up resentment over not reaching the heights you have known you were destined for since you were  or whatever
It will only fuel the fire of the bad open micer
But he wasnt wrong about his act
Especially if youre Mike O Keefe
Im against sending that type of  to anyone out of principle
Whereas Mike sees himself as a true journeyman of the craft and TJ as an interloper hence the rage
Hes terrible
Wait who sent the text
Ive only been universally praised for my comedy which is why I do it so infrequently
guys this happens to everyone right
his online behavior is odd
guys right
I think hes probably fine but moreso knows a lot of people and gets them to go to his shows
its a badge of honor
happened to me after every show its part of the evolution
we should all post our screenshots of bookers who told us to quit in solidarity
Like was Mike right to send that to him lol
We talked a bit about this yesterday but I am curious if TJ is any good at comedy
this is awesome

My hope was to refinance this year but now that Trump is in office long term interest rates are going up
Im not gonna increase rent this year but like fuuuuuuck
But the bank increased my mortgage soon after that by about  which put me in an even less comfortable position
I had to increase them when I bought the property so theyd actually cover a reasonable amount of the mortgage And even then we were paying a bunch on top to make the mortgage
But it would put me in a position where I definitely wouldnt need to increase them for a long while
Yeah totally not saying rents would necessarily decrease
I have this print setup that makes a lot of imperfections in the gobo Im projecting on the wall and it looks super sick
Look at how sick this gobo looks that I made to project onto the garage

Haha who is this
Should I request
say theyre just trying to get more money out of you everyone will gasp
Im requesting an inperson hearing Im gonna go hard
I cant help but feel like this location specifically is a political thing
show them this
Theres one property near me that is worth like M that one that sold in  and its been assessed at K
Im like feeling motivated to gather more broad data on this like this is pissing me off so much
ill clear this up
cc me
its based on value
yeah you should be right actually its not based on sale price in illinois
Im paying  in taxes
And thats the other thing a property that sold a month before mine is paying  in taxes based on its sale price
I shouldnt be penalized for buying a property in the area more recently than a bunch of other people in the area
Theyre assessing the values of all these properties at  of the value of my own home when the assessed value on public realestate listings are all between  the value of mine
yeah that sucks idk i unfortunately have heard the sale price holds a lot of weight with these things but im no expert
I wouldnt have an issue with it if they didnt also assess the value of all the properties in the area
Sure and thats a fair way to assess a propertys value
i think what theyre saying is its based on the sale price which idk if thats true or not but that sounds like what theyre saying
just like public documentation showing what it looks like inside etc
Or similar
But they all either have public rental listings
None of these comparable properties have been sold in the past  years except  that sold a month before mine and  that sold in 
They have a tool that you can actually really easily find comparable properties to your own And its based on proximity age size and classification So like comparable would be basically any property within a certain distance with very similar characteristics
like when you say comparable you mean they sold for a similar price
comparable as in their recent selling price
Thats how this works
Or I should be paying less
OK so if thats the case all of these other places should be paying more
I gave the property tax appeals office this very thorough property tax appeal that cites multiple comparable properties that are all paying about  of the property taxes Im paying And they denied my appeal by saying yeah but your property sold for this amount recently
wait what happened
This property assessment thing is really pissing me off
I mightve gone to the wrong one

I think its funny but I also think nobody will know its a joke haha
Sorry guys I thought it was funny but maybe Ive been smoking too much weed lately
thought you all might could use a laugh
i just saw a tweet say their mom called this a spinning sharon or something sort of humorsome
Maybe theyre a cover band 
Ask if they play any songs by Slipknot
hanging out w mastodon still dont know who these guys are
this was literally the mosh pit
Watching Texas cheerleader murder plot rn
Is there an activity tn
Dude I wanna skip in the mosh pit that sounds fun
I want to diy a g force astronaut training rig
What do you mean by skipping
Also Aarons bringing his baby and he said we could put him on the lazy Susan and spin him around really fast just to see what happens
Lemme guess Theyre all bald too 
am i crazy
like its just the phylzzz crew the band over is next to them but like i feel like saying the mosh was skipping is soooo valid
APOLOGIZE TO HIM
ok but back to this im so annoyed that it felt like i crossed the line
who cares
the mastodon guy just drank an NA beer w me
smdh
its just the phylzzz green room
Just telling them theyre pussies
yeah but they have their separate green room
Lol ur in the mastadon green room
it wasnt even about that band it was about the band after them
But I think everyone can afford to be a lil silly
I cant speak to how bands treat  view their cultural touchstones
im not crazy right thats not crossing the line thats just like funny
and the room got really tense
i think i pissed off the green room bc i mentioned that the mosh pit was skipping instead of moshing

How would that move the needle
QXY rules though if the boys want soup dumplings and phenomenal service
What if I said I want triple crown
Im feeling kind of sick right now probably not gonna make it to lunch brunch
Maddie your contributions are always incredibly insightful and always appreciated
QXY is not big round lazy Susan style tables its two tops and four top style but I have seen them pushed together to make six never  thats my contribution to the boys brunch
Some of Tims closest friends think that he is other bald Logan square dudes in a public setting

"This is a deep sickness that I have but sometimes I listen to podcast from Chicago comedians to make myself mad

And I listened to Aaron chases podcast where he interviewed Mar McFly and he made up some story about how he had a threesome with two lesbians on a beach"

never met him but i know he was shitty to victoria
One time he tried to roast me after the roast show and I said you have to say hello first and he got weird
hahahahahaha
Mar McFly should only be posting things like remember when standup was just bombing for five minutes

CTE
For real actively walking around the Wolfbait gift shop having panic attack trying to think of gifts for my boyfriends family seeing this and shedding a real tear at the gentle beauty of this NFL gifting story when the Care makes you thoughtful
Clear Eyes Full Hearts Sharp and Unique Swords cant lose
The most ancient form of respect 
This is a real leader
Bengals qb Joe burrow confirmed weeb

Screaming at the top of my lungs Lets do a chat trip
You set your nickname to busy
Eric Sony and Hypnosis set the nickname for Andrew Shankland to Mr Android
I have something then
today
due to the meeting
so if i dont respond dont take it personally on account of im just busy
just a heads up everyone today im gonna be super busy cause i have a meeting at  and am gonna be thinking about it before and reflecting on it after
i always read it as short for twink
Kids at school are calling me mr Android because of my busted ass phone
Gonna start saying this to my cat
Chicago sky player kamilla Cardoso is playing in China and this is a quote from her coach lol
Its also the title of a Beatles song
which is like so dont come to school tomorrow vibes
and its tomorrow never knows
but then i looked up what tnk stood for
just got asked to open for parkers show at the TNK fest
Sargon of Akkad
Theres only one TRUE king of the world
WTF
Nobodys here except Kristi
You wont believe how sober everyone was
Yall will never believe how great it went
IM GONNA SHOW OFF MY NEW POLO SHIRT
sure why not
Me and Rebecca exchanged Christmas gifts
SHOULD I COME TO COLES STIL
Sounds like you just got a condo on Live Your Life Boulevard
im like what the hell
he just bought me another one
awesome vibes here on kms ave
rovaughn hill just stole my vodka soda
On the corner of KMS avenue and the boulevard of broken dreams
Im gonna go to Coles around  and have the best set of my life
wow this set at lf just made me go on kms ave
Who goin Coles
Ill be there running around like a gopher for the social media team lol
It was a funny joke that wouldve aged just really perfectly but I wasnt sure if this was a situation where maybe you werent wanting that sort of joke so I decided Ill just keep it to myself
Pinball sounds cool
Where
I cant Im going to a pinball convention that day
Why you delete
Anyone want to go to a Chicago wolves game on Jan 
Its mono red aggro
Might delete it
Anyone want me to do this for their linkdn
Gonna keep it
Hmmmmm
Unless the dating meta has shifted
Might come off as a little too strong
Id say maybe
Hard to say
Is this too much for hinge
True but if its bad at the start usually stays hard
I feel like I usually see them the other way
That was what made me think it was kind of noteworthy tbh
Its not supposed to be like that
Sometimes stuff like this is all about perspective
Not so crazy now huh
Took a live by mistake leave me alone
But there is a car fully upside down in front of scofflaw
No I had to take the picture on the sky and I thought it turned out
Ah shit
thats what i was gonna say girl
bisexual movie star voted for No in the poll
SpongeBob father of one voted for No in the poll
bruh 
Andrew Ill just say this
Jeff voted for No in the poll
Leaving it up so I can learn to sit my ass down and listen
Dont like that riff
On the red pill network
Ill be back in chicago next weekend
Only if its a podcast
I have been working out some ideas
Lmk if you wanna talk about women as a whole one of these days on a google video hang
Yeah like I feel like communication is actually one of the difficult parts of a relationship that isnt good after  dates and takes work but we
also early breakups suck bc i feel like nobody knows how to say hey just not feeling it
And add each other on Linkdn
All you gotta say is its not the right connection
After four dates
Citing specifics for why something isnt working is a red flag
the lil beekeepers son voted for No in the poll
A Brooklyn heartache is required within the first few months you juuuuust squeaked it in
Yeah see I thought this was a thing we had going for us lol
also this is a bad time to announce im gonna go no sugar diet in january and id love to have a great dinner with everyone before the year is over
but overall andrew u dont want someone whos just picking u apart instead of working with you seems like they have some communicating to do themselves
Its super weird being a people pleaser with a person who is sending mixed messages like that makes you feel a lil nuts
I stand by it
Hahahaha
oh come on say it
Nevermind I am actually chill
doorcam voted for No in the poll
God I just feel so Autistic
i for one like a vent sesh and am happy to help
Is this true about women
Appreciate the kind words folks sorry to put this in the chat instead of my regular brand of proactive comedy
Amen
more importantly women will always find a reason to be mad at u
You didnt do anything she just wasnt the person for you and thats ok It sucks for sure but you didnt do anything wrong
People dont get less difficult the more you know them
I think its perfectly reasonable to be confused if just think of this as saving you a lot of figure grief
its giving bpd no shade
Especially at the start
things should be easy not confusing and hard
Im saying it was maybe not worth it considering its been confusing the whole time
My vote is not in regards to your situation I just think you are one of the few people in the chat who shouldnt ever be confused and it is wrong if you ever are
Yeah we were like having a perfectly fine night and then she kinda just broke it off and started citing all these small weird moments we had
Mitchie changed their vote to No in the poll
but also this kind of pattern this early on maybe ya dodged a bullet
Mitchie voted for Yes in the poll
no i would be genuinely so confused
Oh yeah no I feel like she was giving off mixed signals this whole time And also shes just been weird in general like the night she randomly seemed pissed at me before Id spoken to her despite nothing having happened between us and then she was fine the next time I saw her
Eric Sony and Hypnosis voted for Yes in the poll
Samuel Housing Authority voted for No in the poll
bacon egg and cheese created a poll Is Andrew wrong for being conf
clear sign that your communication skills need work
I thought this would be a poll
Am I wrong for being confused by this
And also doesnt want to text which is a boundary Ive been respecting
The girl Ive been seeing ended things with me last night and she said it was because we arent communicating well But weve been on like  dates and she specifically told me she wanted to take it slow
Id consider it the main point of the chat
Go off
Can I poll the chat on a question about my personal life please
Its the busiest Costco in the Midwest

Onstage
Imagine I get onstage and fall right over cheetos spilling everywhere
If the audience were good I would have swept them up myself and used them for my entrance
Ok last night I saw a man at LF trip and spill a bag of cheetos and it truly made me laugh harder than any comedy show
Ive heard mixed things
How was it
at a yk screeening and its empty
I submitted a bunch of old ones to the treasurer and it still hasnt cleared
You might be able to cash that in directly to the bank to avoid the treasury
They take so long to cash in
Just not like dying laughing or anything
Audience is listening
Its not bad
""
How many audience members are there Johnbo Walter Stockwell 
WHAT THE SAM HELL
The important thing is that the comedy show continues even if its bad and nobody wants to be there
Cowboys been tucking himself in recently

"shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit its your birthday Meg Mc  

clay davis from the wire never watched it but assume this is the context"
Happy birfday Megan
Happy birthday Megan
Yeeeeeah its gonna be a happy birthday from me dawg Randy Jackson
happy birthday Meg Mc  
Was it good I want to see it
think im gonna see it tn
is yk any good
Gah every pic of her goes hard
Missing her
Yeah thats the worst part
Ya and I think opposition is doubling coming down on him and trying to make his shortcomings more of a thing to point to never electing like a teacher or left leaning guy again
But thats kind or more vibe based than anything
I also think maybe he wasnt the best choice for CTU to tap for the nomination and hes having the pay the price for not being a food enough politician to do the job well
Its really good
Anybody play chants of sennaar
Become a comedian
I think with Brandon Johnson a lot of people on both sides of the issue arent loving how hes handling the migrant crisis
I think Anthony Siraguse said he surrounded himself with a badincompetent team
I feel like hes doing not a great job overall but also all the videos I see of him and the comments are def heavily pushing an agenda
Love the vibe but Im neutral on the taste
IDK about the Brandon johnson stuff
Diet Coke propaganda has been everywhere lately
Id be right there with her 
I saw someone yelling at the meeting today and I was like wheres this coming from
Lisa Barlow marches on Washington
Is it holding up pension payments
I dont get that part
Yeah but like why do normal people care
Its like how rfk said hes going to get rid of Diet Coke as soon as trump is inaugurated
he keeps holding off the budget
Does anyone know why emotions are high with Brandon Johnson
No its bc tiktok is where everyone is finding out about genocide and they dont have control over the flow of information in the same way
Ill have an update for you tomorrow on progress
I started working on em today
Hahahahahahahaha
They found out how much storage space they were paying for when they saw all the unread Tik Toks in John and Aarons inbox from me
But who knows
I feel like Congress sees it as more of an existential risk if China has access to that data
im gonna go non verbal
no one should be allowed to benefit from your data unless they work for a good old fashioned american company
this is happening to protect you from china
why
wait why is this happening to us
Oh man chat is gonna have a rough week
it is so much worse than tt its kinda crazy
no ik thats why I was trying to figure out reels
i have like a severe addiction and idk how im gonna handle being cold turkey
wait this is like really not good for my whole thing i got going on where i lay in bed and watch tiktoks until danny gets worried
its truly bullshit
And were all headlining
Yup
Comedy Cabin
And you know what Im keeping it
I got a tattoo
We should have a wake
it cant be real
is this real

Thank u kings
Or a screw extractor
Ill look for pliers
And thank you WAYFAIR
Ohhh good idea thank you 
Since the threads are exposed on the opposite side easiest solution might be to grip it with pliers on that end and twist
In a pinch you can use the Allen key with it but put some aluminum foil around it and shove it in until you have enough grip to turn it
Maybe if you can grip it with pliers you can unscrew it
You need a screw extractor
Advice 
Im trying to disassemble my bed frame but this screw is so worn out I cant take it out lol

whats going on
Thats really smart to have thought to done that
yeah i came up with remembering this just now
Thats a really beautiful poem 
Did u just come up with that
"Im gonna make a change
For once in my life
Its gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind pretending not to see their needs

A summers disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one mans soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
Cause they got nowhere to go
Thats why I want you to know

Im starting with the man in the mirror
Im asking him to change his ways
And no  couldve been any clearer
If they wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Ive been a victim of a selfish kind of love
Its time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that theyre not alone

A willow deeply scarred
Somebodys broken heart
And a washed out dream washed out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya see
Cause they got no place to be
Thats why Im starting with me

Im starting with the man in the mirror oh
Im asking him to change his ways oh
And no  couldve been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Im starting with the man in the mirror oh
Im asking him to change his ways oh
And no  couldve been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change

Im starting with the man in the mirror oh yeah
Im asking him to change his ways better change
No  couldve been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

You gotta get it right while you got the time
Cause when you close your heart you cant
Then you close your close your your mind
With the man in the mirror oh yeah
Im asking him to change his ways better change
No  couldve been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Oh yeah gonna feel real good now

Im gonna make a change
Its gonna feel real good
Come on change
Just lift yourself
You know
Youve got to stop it
Yourself yeah

Make that change
Ive got to make that change today
Man in the mirror you got to
You got to not let yourself brother
Yeah you know
Make that change Ive got to get that man that man

Youve got to
Youve got to move
Come on
Come on
You got to
Stand up stand up yeah make that change
Stand up

Stand up and lift
Yourself now
Man in the mirror

Yeah make that change
Gonna make that change come on
Man in the mirror

You know it
You know it
You know it
You know
Change
Make that change"
yeah to that ill say
And insulted youd say it is
Not the same
Sorry its not
yeah ive been running in shorts and figure its similar
Its pretty nice
Ive been doing cold plunges on my legs after skateboarding
Ooof
i have not and i cant believe i ever did that it was so cold
That may be the difference here
Have you been keeping up on cold plunging
i dont think luigi should have yelled at the media but im no vigilante
my close personal friend avatara
is instagram down
Just leave behind a Drive Damage Depart sticker
But I could hitandrun a CEOs car
Im not quite hardcore enough to do the full Luigi
The hit and runners manifesto
"Drive
Damage
Depart"
"Damage
Dump
Demolish"
I cant believe theyd put in this much planning just to take out your means of transportation
This is like when Luigi Mangione shot that CEO but its a city worker and your car
Its nice you got the note
Is ur car drive able
Idk but people left a note with a plate number
Are u gonna be compensated
How did u find out
Damn that sucks man
A sanitation truck hit my parked car
This is really really funny
it was obv tasty but the best thing was watching all the like Bridgeport lifer groundskeeping old dudes be like what da hell is this I dont know about soup you eat with chopsticks
it was soo sick
the only thing getting me through the day is that they had a pho bar at the white sox employee cafeteria
In light of recent events I will now always be coated in a layer of our experimental bulletproof lotion for men
it was more like so crazy that Luigi did that I actually know his family
no his family is like prominent in Baltimore
Im actually cool if you get me
Im not like other ceos
Is he trying to be like a pick me ceo
Yeah what was his take or perspective
I bet he was like at the same country club party as them
the ceo is from Maryland so is probably just bragging about proximity to wealth
I would instantly stop liking him if I knew he bought from this company
Do you guys sell trigger finger lotion
Look him up in the system and see if he bought anything
Cant believe messenger is out when I just heard the tiege ceo say that he knew Luigis parents
Kingdom Come Deliverance
Lemme boot it up right now and check
I feel like Id love that
Which game
And play my game about being a medieval peasant
Just wanna chill
Im struggling to work these past few days
Office vibes are particularly bleak today
weird phone who dis
yeah one sec my phone is weird
Did you also send the response
I dont know that it is
is it not sending
I know we have a long history and the kids miss you but Im featuring you in a piece Im writing for the New Yorker
like i sucked ur thumb for two hours one night ago threee years ago dont talk to me like im ur ex wife
ok but dont u hate this response
hahaHAHAHA
Thats much better than him asking about the ass cookies
Oh lol
however it is all about the tramp stamp show promo
so i assumed it was my latest reel
oh wait yeah forgot to update its not the reel its roadkill show poster actually i was scared to open it at first
Yeah weird If it was a listicle or something itd make sense if he wanted a quote or something to add to it but
i asked him what hes writing about and he said a column on organic promo that hes sending to many industry people and then sent  ur welcome xx
i think its weird that he wasnt like hey im thinking about writing about u for this what do u think
hes a social media analyst thats not the weird part to me
Why would he need the insights
To ask for food in want I make the animal noises 
featuring it for an article
Lmfao
ask if im ok w that first hahahaha
does he have to like
that stamptown brother i hooked up w three years ago just randomly DMd me can i have the insights for ur latest reel featuring it on an article
I hear if you die in Japan you die in real life
Yeah I guess
That would probably happen here too honestly
A guy mean mugged me bc I showed his girl shrek
At a club in Japan and kept showing girls pictures of shrek
I would honestly love to see the vibe
Damn true
Isnt that better than work
But consider this you get to pay  to watch other people who think paying  for an open mic is a good idea and you cant leave
pm on a Wednesday is a horrible time
And I cant I work normal hours
I know the host
Fear City indeed
you couldnt design a worse open mic
arbitrary threats of banning
no list chosen at random
being punished for showing any time before 
Pay to go up
PM
Ill venmo you  to go to this
you need to go for me
What schizophrenic posted this
You can tell all of NYs best comics go to this mic
Ive walked by it and been bummed out just by the vibe from outside
This place seems awesome
Also sorry but being banned from Fear City comedy club is like being banned from Kansas I wasnt going anyways
I think its cool to pay for something and get banned for having to leave a bit early
Idk I think its about time that somebody made open mics feel like a bad time
Hellish vibe
Getting Christmas cards ready
I liked it
Thinking about defending my polycues honor
Pretty good
Any you seen Black Doves on Netflix
genuinely amazing post
Whos he talking about
On my insta story
JFL Vancouver haha  to how I said I was flicking the bean to their poster

Me too in addition as well pls
Absolutely

Just sent it to you
Is there an FB event for the LF party I feel like there usually is one
Love it
Mitch lowkey a sassy brat
Im gonna ask  comics who Ive never spoken to if they want to produce a lodge show with me
Im gonna tell everyone they were snubbed by the gazellies this year
Its incredible
People who do two mics a year walk up to you and just say Im doing some networking with you right now
Its one of the rare times all of my favorite people and all of my least favorite people are in the same room
I cant wait
Its the best people watching day of the year
Im gonna tell Katie Zane to keep at it
I thought it was usually thursdays but Im gonna go and get so drunk that I tell Chicagos worst comedians that I love them
It seems feral
Whats the vibe of it
No tomorrow
wait is the LF party tonight
no Im asking
I feel like they usually cancel it the week of the holiday party
Oh yeah maybe the mic is off
LF holiday party is this week
Just in case
Bring your packet
Mostly a place to network for laughable news
Go with the expectation you will not be performing
Tough to get on
Yeah its fun
Has anyone done the laugh factory mic before
No
Nvm
Is In lieu of gi anything
Theres a guy here who keeps saying he looks like Luigi and its likebuddy you look nothing like him
I want the whole chat to go
If you guys dont go to Japan Im gonna be so mad
I keep meeting Israelis who are hot 
new years resolution is to write more manifestos
everyone maintain joint mobility please  literally move your joints to keep em healthy especially your back
honestly the biggest takeaway ive learned so far is to never get back surgery
the th grader i tutored had experience in this assassin game
"

Manifesto dropped"
i  dropshipping
currently writing about how there is so much merch for Luigi because of the rise of print on demand Its so funny that every etsy seller selling deny defend depose tshirts also has MAGA shirts and pride shirts for sale in there shops
""
If you want a good take perchance
I concerned people are going to start slapping standups
I feel like so many journalists are disconnected from reality
do something 
Im just obsessed with the fact that the guy was a lindy manpaul skallas head
Waiting on the steakums x account to weigh in
But no company or brand is going to be like we agree with the internet Its good that the ceo was killedl
Yeah so many people see it as the senseless taking of a life like any other murder instead of a targeted attack of the head of a company that sent a  that desperately needed to be sent
Nooooooooo
Oh nooooo shooters are going start trying to shoot rich powerful politically polarizing people
Because then every loser will want to be him instead of shooting innocent people at a mall
Thats why its cool that hes hot and impressive
Targeted killings in
Mass shootings out
smdh
dont love the chanification of john stockwell
smdh
Next youre gonna ask what skibidi toilet is
Just sit in your apartment looking at the wall
Jesus Christ what do you do all day
blaming everything i dont like on the chanification
I guess these people will throw any garbage take against the wall tho instead of giving any sort of weight to the fact that an overwhelming majority of people like that this guy did that
this is just as bad as when incels celebrate school shootings
The chanification
Lol what a stupid take
""
worst take alert
He excelled in evading the police after evading the goose in duck duck go
"Or like 

He did a mob hit and we learned that him and his friends were a group that regularly role played as mob members 

In the card game Mafia"
"Basically the equivalent of being like 

This murderer who killed a plumber has some experience with this because in college he played Mario video games"
Can someone explain to a nongamer what this means
The humble comedian
Humble
I think some studios are selling cool art but I will just simply have photos of my friends doing plays and a bunch of beers
Spreading this invite far and wide cuz I think it will be very fun and also I owe everyone a beer for making you listen to my UHC shooter conspiracy theory 
""
Feeling cool 
Opportunity to have a cool roommate
idk why they would make up something like thaty
yeah dont be scared of that
I dont think thats true
someone said this means theres a waluigi working in private equity somewhere
Free Luigi
Damn
Like what the fuck
Im diving deep into this luigi stuff man
""
Getting paid to poop is one of the small pleasures of working And nobody will question it because its embarrassing for them
Any relation to the satire writer Nate Odenkirk
its been  min and they gotttaaa be wondering where i am but i do t wanna text my manager that im pooooping in a major way
stuck on the toilet at work its hell on earth
The perfect spot to reflect
hes repped by naomi odenkirk
Which is maybe why he was just hanging in a McDonalds I mean
I think this is  right I was thinking about how America is so accustomed to senseless violence that when there is a logic or sense to what someone did there is a immediate sympathy and kind of assuming hes a genius But he can be both kinda smart and also kinda manic and not thinking through what would happen afterwards
lol
Jake Prizant is in a Potbelly ad
but i do magnesium and ashwagunda and cortisol reducers
ok not to out myself as a hippie
I use a drug called marijuana spelling when Im anxious
Not a book and maybe unhelpful but I know people who have taken magnesium pills to help with anxiety symptoms
Ive heard those are good idk my brain is fine
The worry trick the untethered soul the art of letting go
I have it in my hotel room Ill try to find it
Teaches you to be your friend along da way
Oh um I think this self compassion book goes hard
Quran
How to gain friends and win influence
Sorry chat but does anyone have any book recs for dealing with anxiety Ive got some goals Im trying to achieve that are definitely not related to recent news events
Also new sick jacket for cheap
Some Russians did a photoshoot with me
Now that the dust has settled a little bit from today it needs to be appreciated how fucking funny it is that William Bankss big project that hes been working on for months was launched on the day of the biggest arrest and jailing in recent history
I also believe he had a lot of actual material
I love what Ryans doing onstage and am laughing with not at him ftr
It kind of intersects with laughing at him
it also would have been a  hour and  min show but mike robinson dropped
Like you can give him the phone book and it would be fun to watch him read it
Like they dont make jokes they just ARE and its funny to watch
ryan did so bad that grace called kiehron in to drop in after his set
Thats the category of comic he falls into Ive seen them before
I was real stoked to see you did Rib tips at lf
not only was it two hours long but it was  hours and fifteen minutes
Also how was your 
Wait can you confirm that this show is  hours long
im genuinely confused if people are making fun of him or like him
What if she had her period halfway through
I dont think a woman could do that set
IDK
i feel like if a girl did that set they simply wouldnt book her
Poor kid
But I also get how he could bomb for  minutes straight lol
Yeah hes one of those people whose jokes arent for anyone idk how to describe it I like seeing him on stage
Hahahahahahahahahaha
Im all in on Ryan
He crushed for  minutes straight at his laugh factory show
it was silent for  min
he followed me at headliners
Where are you watching Ryan do  mins
Does anyone emotionally connect to this hat
One day hes gonna be a  year old man who acts like that
This is his past life
Hes not meant for this timeline
He is supposed to be a s dustbowl vagrant working for beans from farm to farm train to train
i just dont get whats real im confused
im like is he trying to do like joe pera core
He dont seem like a tantrum guy
Unless theyre throwing a tantrum
No one really bombs on purpose
Idk man
I think he thinks they just dont get it
hes walked five people so far hes half way thru his half hour
or is he just binning
is ryan oliver going for like bombing
ok im confused
Bought this bad boy
and then we can decide the pope of the chat
When you see it well add you to conclave chat
I saw it as well With Adrienne Stout
i loved it
Adrienne Stout saw it
Might fuck around and hit up a matinee tomorrow
Hate to distract from the assassin talk but has anyone in the chat seen conclave
Wonder if Luigi and William Banks are in the same jail
ive heard of a haircut but thats ridiculous
Dude paid attention to literally each strand of hair
conspiracy twitter discovering the concept of a scatterbrained genius
Knows his angles
Gotta hit the gym and work on my assassin bod
he sounds like an esfj
Murder for a cause is so sigma
Hed be a hero to everyone
I feel like inmates would love him
the fact is that he was a meatball but the question is was he neurospicy well have to wait to see the court evidence
I want a John wick quiet gun
And no one catch him
It would have been so sick for CEOs to live in permanent fear
I saw a video of someone using the same gun setup and its literally silent Its just clicking noises lol that insane that thats legal
Eating a cheeseburger was actually the activation action for my and hundreds of other sleeper cell ivy league school Andrew huberman trained assassins
Italian intuition
The silencer and the weird bullets
""
he should have gotten time and a half to prepare
Im just so curious how he got that insane load out
Very Italian to lower your mask to flirt
Maybe he had sensory sensitivities and had to let the skin breathe
a slightly impulsive meatball
i guess its a trade off between looking normal and being camouflaged but seems very not smart to have been bare faced on surveillance
If he wore a prosthetic  face I think he wouldve gotten away with it
united healthcare is so bad
Bro
""
Egirl hiding in cakes
People are gonna break into jail to fuck him
lol
im gagged
im sorry but the girl i had every class at depaul with making it in this post
Hot guy name I guess
Can I just add a random Italian as a placeholder
Oh nvm
Would we be on a watchlist if I add him to the chat
all his socials are deleted now
His was different somehow
We mustve not been smoking the same weed
Hes just like every dude I smoked weed with in college for real
Thats all Trump does about healthcare lol
Goddamn
It would be such a wild card if Trump pardoned him
Michell Potts Pardon Power 
Not if I have anything to say about it
Damn imagine if the trump shooter lived to hear himself get compared to this chad
Hell see it in 
Just the word respect
Joe has DMd him
They dont have the chops
Are we competing with Joe Eames chat
So this is how brat summer ends Not with a whimper but a bang
I only just got around to following him on IG and let me tell ya we are not the only group chat thirsting after our boy Luigi
I know hes probably dealing with a lot but I do wonder if part of him is like my boys chat is going off right now
adding Kill Bluecross CEO to my goals
going over my self evaluation for the year

Gotta add him to the chat
confirmed bisexual

I wish we could add him to the chat
Hes one of charlis angels 
If hed finished level  those bullets would have said zip zap zop
Representation is so important
Somebody on Twitter confirmed that hes taken at least one improv class
Hes so foine
wish i could DM her lol
That is absolutely wild
Oh my god
i had like every depaul class w the girl in this pic
a girl i went to depaul with is his friend
going back to the assassin
Go off
this day is a rollercoaster
god i have more gossip
Cant stop watching sister wives today
its absolute reddit humor
Hes already got a guy throwing gang signs
Like the idea of the bit is funny but I feel like hes going to hit some pretty rough stereotypes
Like its an annoying movement but even lamer to not get that its a joke as a comic
Theres a comic at that laugh factory that has a bit about this but she doesnt understand its a joke so she just looks silly
It feels like when Elon Musk references Dogecoin
Its really lame
Or he shouldve filmed his court trial and found out that the judge has a car world tattoo
its been fun playing journalist i cannot lie
Im going to New York this weekend and Im going to free him from his bit
he just needs to post this
Its very easy actually to end the bit without going back which is just be like they released me from prison early due to good behavior
clare austen smith  bianca ian lockwood
few sources
ive gone too far i cant go back
like literally so is a hotdog a sandwichcore
and he is like
i guess one of his friends talked to him and was like u can really stop this u know
Who is your source or is it confidential
Thats awesome and will go over well
I cannot stand the birds arent real thing
hes gonna release videos this week of him being beat up by actors in his fake jail

In mine craft parody etc
Why cant we do the same with alt comedians
The FBI does it with mentally ill people all the time
Honestly we should be enabling William Banks to be the next Mangione

For technicians yes We had two Rasta guys  one really short and one very tall and the short one quit yesterday
Hell are they hiring
Could be worse
And its closer to my apartment than when I worked in midtown and I work only  as opposed to  like I did
Thats the spirit
Gonna be honest Easiest job Ive ever had though
Hey Sam this job sounds like it sucks
And everyone was very chill about it
Today there was a woman who barricaded herself and someone else in their apartment and was like making threats and cops got called and ALSO in another building a guy got shot and killed
Still fine I think
but also the person in contact is the recruiter not the girl who interviewed me
downtown hunni more like my ass on the couch
Oh you can follow up day of

Debbie is thriving
OK the purse has been returned
Can you pick up a standing desk for me too
Hahahahaha
my pussy i fuck i have a small wiener
What was that quote from comedy gazelle fuck pussy bitch
This was honestly my first thought but I didnt want to make assumptions
""
And all I humbly ask for is a finders fee of 
Oh hell yeah
Major Deborah update I am on the train to the daley center to return her the purse
Despite all my rage Im am still just a leader who leads 
I thought it was about if a police officer a native American a sailor and a construction worker got gym memberships
Liketheres no way to not come off as homophobic with  that
Its a pretty incredible thing to sue someone about
The quote is its about black guys hanging out theres nothing gay about that
I just read an article about how the guy from the village people who wrote ymca is going to start suing news networks for calling it a gay anthem
Thats a big leaders who lead opportunity
You also have the opportunity to be the first person who likes this
Im glad youre treating yourself while you have COVID
"The bullets say
Middle seats only
No priority boarding
 carryon charge "
Yall can keep dancing on the graves of our brave leaders I will be celebrating them
retvrn 
you used to be able to smoke on the plane people dressed up
I mean its sooo annoying to fly now
Thats the world I wanna live in
Imagine killing the ceo of your airline cuz your flight got delayed
Right but thats a manufacturer
well u really want the boeing ceos to be found in a ditch
Im less hardline about airline ceos but I did learn yesterday that ultimately Im fine with them getting killed too
gonna watch the joker tn
When I realized it was the healthcare company I was immediately like oh yeah well he should die
I thought it was the other United though so I was confused
I was on a date last night and she really didnt like how glad I was that the guy was murdered
Theyre stoked
wait i thought everyone was lowkey excited
 watching someone get murdered  Ill have what hes having
Yeah only if after we get murdered we go to Katz
bleeding out in the street only in New York
Bro Ill be in New York next week lets do the legendary hang of Starbucks photo op getting murdered
This city never sleeps Manhattan is always a party
What if the bullets said pussy money weed
I was like damn thats hardcore but if thats what were doing Im onboard
I only skimmed the headline yesterday and thought everyone was real excited about the ceo of united airlines getting killed
If youre going to pull something crazy like this youd be stupid not do do something like that
Somebody posted this in the Simpsons Reddit and its perfect
Its like ok one guy getting killed in the street like a dog is sad in itself but dont ask me to mourn for him any harder than the literal millions of people who have suffered and died far worse deaths due to the very profitable choices made by people like this guy
kinda wild hes still at large
I saw this really good quote from Mark twain that I think sums up how many people are feeling about this incident
Also he was wearing a camera backpack lol
Thats why in the video hes constantly pulling the back of the gun
The gun didnt jam hes using subsonic rounds that dont automatically eject so he has to eject them by hand the subsonic rounds with the silencer made it much much quieter
Also whats crazy
Some riddler ass shit
Also whats crazy about the assassin he left bullets that had written on them words like defend deny depose
I saw them
They flirted at a party
mf not getting caught
Shes a long time supporter of laughable news
Hahahahaha
im going to have a convo with her
why does my younger sister follow brian roe
Yeah there were some stories of there saying he got away on a citi bike but now theyre saying that didnt happen nor sure what to believe in regards to that but he is still at large
I think its safe to say he knows someone who died or greatly suffered from the company fucking up their life because pretty much all of us know someone thats happened to
and he was just on a bike
Im going to go out on a limb and say there was intent
Its united Healthcare they are notable for denying claims at a higher rate than other companies
brian roe is a babe
like with intention or just random
wooooah
In da big apple
wait it was on a lime scooter but for bikes
A guy just walked up to a CEO of a major health care company and fucking smoked him
was he a bad guy
why did he get got
He was being too good at being a ceo
wait ok still havent checked my phone in a major way  did a ceo get assassinated
Jesus fucking christ lol
Good song for the daft punk type fans tbh
This slaps
Hold on
"

My top track this year"
I think a lot of CEOs have gone in and out of court for anti trust or insider trading stuff My impression is that its sort of normal honestly
Too cold inside
Where are folks tonight
Lmao thats a pretty good Photoshop
Deborah Johnigan Protector any update from Deb
Lmaoooooo get his ass
Am I seeing double
Easy choice
And unearned confidence
Bro has an ugly soul
Honestly so funny that women think he is hot until he starts speaking
Lol so many people have his face shape
Yes they have the same face shape
Anybody else get Brian roe vibes from Nick on love is blind
Jolly beans burner account
Constructive criticism stings the most
I apologized getting a hang of key phrases
"A museum worker approached me and some reason 
my first thought was my ween shirt was too casual for the imperial palace it was for chewing gum"
Im gonna submit a packet to laughable news
They were able to see straight thru all the production and jokes
Lol yeah its crazy that Brian wasnt able to pull a fast one over on randos
know
Damn even the randoms think its bad
Damn
Hes gonna have to put the stream up early or he might crash the servers
Laughable News tomorrow is going to be ELECTRIC
The laughable news
Oh gosh
Cant wait for Brian Roes take on this whole thing
Hahahahahaha
Got smoked twice today
Damn he got smoked
k laugh reacts
You do Im just being a radical extremist
We all know the hierarchy goes this one health care CEO and then landlords are next
I feel like I make a good case 
And besides
You just have bad opinions
No of course nto
THE BIRTHDAY CURSE HAS NO EFFECT ON MY OPINIONS
Hes the most establishment person in the group chat
I think they have camera footage of it
Well we should also take everything John says with a grain of salt
how do they know it was a citi bike and not just like his own electric bike
A high tourist and commuter area Wherever he leaves that eCiti bike its getting used by someone else within the next  minutes
Think about it too
There are def ways to get an electric citi bike and not have the account or card youre using traced back to you
"The options are 
 On foot
 Bike
 Motorcycle"
Also I feel like getting away on an electric Citi bike is the play in Manhattan you cant drive a car down there and anything else is public transit
Really straight forward
 of the time to unjam a gun you basically just cock the gun again
Sincerely not hard
Climate Conscious healthcare defending king 
""
changed the location to rainbo club
ive been running around looking for balloons
wait what was there a shooting
But of course they mispronounced it  fml NowWellNeverKnow
I just saw the clip where the Starbucks workers are trying to read the name written on the killers gun before they hand it off to him
I just found a clip where you can hear the audio and the shooter goes sir will you sign my gun Oh no Its slipping out of my hands and then the gun goes off and he goes noooo I didnt mean to kill you
Idk maybe more people will ruminate on stuff like this
Its like u got the shinzo abe guy and then this one
And idk maybe nothing will happen but if they dont find the killer or dif up more info
Well even if there was a conspiracysomething to cover up shareholders I think most people will probably buy that this was a frustrated citizen caught up in grievances
The citizens of kms avenue are hanging on by a thread
You guys please do not solve this I need this
But at the end of the day I think it was just all a big misunderstanding that was actually also an accident
Citi bike thing is a good point that seems v trackable
no pressure i know theres this thing called coles tn
but probs pm bar time
time TBD were going to ahkoshi by mustache so were about to see how long were waiting
Yo whats up guys welcome to how to kill a CEO in broad daylight todays video is brought to you by DRAFTKINGS sportsbook
Tell him Happy birthday day from me
and im gonna surprise him at best intentions after dinner with pals
Yooo
its my boyfriends bday
but at the end of the day
wait sorry i know were in a big convo
I feel like based on these new conspiracy things arising this will be quickly memoryholed like the airline whistleblower they killed
But if I was shooting someone and my gun jammed I would look up how to unjam a gun youtube skim through it get to the part where they do it and watch it a couple times
Also I dont know anything about guns
And you go to thailand and hes drinking at the end of the bar
It would be wild if they never did
Its assumed that they will find him
He was buying the Starbucks New York mugs
Sorry if thats a dumb  question I dont want to learn things about NYC
Also are Citi Bikes not linked to your phone Shouldnt they have like all of the guys information
I bet he got one of those Stanley cups and was killed for it 
We dont know
Thats the thing
What was his order
  
Yeah either way we win
CEOs should be scared to be in public 
But I really want to believe its a vigilante
No im getting to the bottom of this
But this is one where I kind of hope we just never know
Hell fucking yeah
I totally agree with you Matty
It feels more like a were worried this guy is gonna flip mob style hit
Yeah I had no idea about the Starbucks camera but thats really interesting
Yea now youre with me Mitchell
Yes Thats what Im saying It doesnt line up that he is on Starbucks cameras also
I think someone not trained wouldve panicked when the gun jammed
The assassin really seemed to know what they were doing
Cuz its like hell yeah
I want it to be angry guy for sure
No totallyyyyy
So I actually think the conspiracy angle is more likely but I find it more inspirational to believe it is a guy who had a claim denied
I think United healthcare is trying to make it seem like its an angry person who like had a claim denied
He rides one of the most trackable modes of transportation
Idk like they have pics of him in a Starbucks This guy just wanted to be seen
Yeah it feels crazy they didnt catch him immediately
In summary insider trading all the stuff about him being in a Starbucks right before the shooting and getting his photo taken and riding a Citibike
Alright fine Ill listen to your podcast
It is well known that Joey has CIA ties
Hahahaha
Im sending a voice memo
Go on
I saw he was getting investigated for insider training
I had to write about it for work and I think it was an inside job sorry I really do
Wait guys I think it was a conspiracy
I just hope we dont see like record speed from congress passing legislation adding extra rights and protection to ceos
If we want any change we gotta get John hinkley jr off his meds
Io
 example of something I would say if I was a crazy guy and not an honest citizen who would never wish harm on someone I love my government
Truly this needs to happen more These people need to be terrified to walk on the streets
Good fun violence works too
It may be This could be huge
King shit
Love that he biked away
If this guy drops a merch store you know Ill be buying
Sometimes violence IS the answer
My company had been BCBS for years and just switched to united for 
gun
Its just nice to see that we are getting some good fun violence over here for once
Ya dont know if theres any hot takes on something that most people universally like or appreciate
goes without saying we approve
Checking in after a long day and honestly Thought the chat was gonna have more hot takes on the united ceo
it probably is bc it says he works at standup comedian 
thats a name i recognize
was it david louis
Mallory Bradford
tina fey
Or Lewis
David something
A friend is asking who hosted the second city open mic in 
Sold out I think idk this shit is goofy
Oh shit but they wear masks for this
Maybe tonight Ill do music
I think Im gonna stick to the boxing
I wonder if wrestling would be more fun tho
My favorite anime has boxing tournaments here
It lacks awareness lol
Lmao I know and I dont understand it either I know cartoonists make like distinctive choices in their drawing style to distinguish their work from other artists But this dude is kind of completely ripping off South Park in every other way
I know you mean racist people but it really looks like youre agreeing with a point hes making
Why do all of their chins look like that
And a little bit Kamala Harris
Sorry it just seems to be Lawrence Fishburn
He does the voice of every black person with an egregious blaccent
every video this guy makes he tags adultswim lmao
something I ALSO kindof really want
they have Gutfeld swag
It devastated me
My mom told me on thanksgiving that shes a big Greg Gutfeld fan
jokes is a strong word for it
Hes literally just ripping off South Park and making conservative oriented jokes
In Japan right now btw
I think its because I was looking at the fox news shop maybe
""
Even better
Also heres something fun to hate watch that I just found
Just get it as is
HAHAHAHAHA
This one is great because you can pretend that youre a host
That is some unregulated emotional fuckery tho lol
Met her at my job and forever like her
I love her still tbh
that would rock
yeah just steal the design
get a cease and desist
Make your own
god I kinda want some fox merch but I dont wanna support fox news
oh man Im gonna make a video about this
I THINK YOU MEAN CHRISTMAS
HOLIDAY

Yes
Was this her email dajohnigancookcountycourtcom
Audrey is asking her friend if she knows her itd be funny if it was Hannah
Mary texted her friend Hannah who literally knows Audrey lol I think they work together
I returned it to his social worker to get it back to him
Circuit Court is what Audrey says
One time I found this teens wallet and he was homeless 
Yeah
Yeah civil dept
Also you could probably bring it to the county building
I just texted Audrey Jonas because she works for the county too and Im like maybe thats her department

THC bomb in the beer tub 
theres a natural human urge to soak in a tub full of something thats not water
But still not sure of the benefits unless you had like an extremely misguided scheme to try to frame someone for drink driving or something
idc if its good for me or not
I lowkey want it to be a bath full of beer
Ya its not literally a bath full of beer I think its like mostly like a hop water bath
dont worry about it
confused why beer would be good to soak in but im in
this sounds perffff
And the part where you actually take a bath in the beerhop water is private for you and your partner
I think the only gendered part is the steam room I cant remember if thats gendered but i think thats also optional
oh hell yeah ty
Its on Milwaukee
Piva I think
Ya I did beer spa once I think its p accommodating
got a nd round interview in thirty min 
looking for the natural wine spa
you should ask one of them the only thing I remember is the phrase beer spa
beer spa im interested
cant remember what the deal with that is like
brook and annaleigh went to that beer spa one time
the only non naked spa is aire and its like  dollars
I was there on a heavy edible once and I thought everyone with a king spa shirt was working there like damn this place has a lot of employees
I like dont think anyone would be too weird on the dude side but I so get not risking it
They give you a uniform
the short king spa
we need a trans friendly spa
god dammit
yeah no clothes allowed in the baths parts
and u have to be naked right
You like king spa Name every temperature they have
I like the one where you  lie on a bunch of tiny wooden blocks
every temperature you can imagine
lol thats literally how I was gonna describe it
They have a bunch of rooms of various temperatures
what else can y do
everything else you can do co ed
the bath parts are the first thing you go through and those are gender separated
i asked before i know but i forget
or all naked gender separated
is king spa something u can do co ed

speaking of how coles is 
And we will NOT be bullied into having the biggest hack category taken away
The GayEllies
We should host a chat award show
He once lectured me on how Coles is bumper bowling for people who want to get Broad City back in the air
With great crowds
Like bombed hard
Hahahahaha he has been there so many times and bombed every time
Could make an argument that hes the worst comedian in Chicago
Comedy Gazelle shouldnt have taken James Najjar winning biggest hack back
Ive seen James He was bad
Ive never seen Bob Keen go to Coles
block party on kms avenue tonight
I cant believe James Najjar went with a  joke in the comments
yeah those were mean
Can Bob and James be banned too
Its so hard to find parking on kms avenue
Banning from doing comedy could be seen as a blessing
Literally every woman has a bad story about him
He sucks kristi dont let him get you down Hes so disingenuous with why he was banned
Since he claimed he got hacked bots have been responding to him
You handled it really well and you deserved more support earlier on
Im sorry you had to deal with this
even when deserved
its better this way but i will say banning people feels bad
Every single week he does something worthy of being banished
Even without being a creep he bullied an autistic man
Its the comedy version of an incel
god im gonna miss the way he brought energy into the room at all these shows
It was my greatest trick yet
Heeee showed up wasted and said some really rude shit
He shows up when you need him the most
i love that on kms avenue week for kristi noshod hopped in to play
At least he will learn and grow from without a doubt
and when i described everything to dustin and morgan they were like u know u can ban people right
he also grabbed the sign up list from me aggressively
Yeah Joey instigated by assuming the best out of people
So he had to be weird
You put him around women
Yeah he was setup to be weird
u guys set me up to be weird at crushes haahahah
he was like
when i told him i wasnt gonna bump him bc he makes my friends feel weird
Little did he know his email in bio could also be used for unbookingd
Dustin welcome to the resistance 
I am Jewish in response to my unsend
i talked to dustin and morgans about like WVERYTHING with him
i didnt even try to ban him
Can we get a behind the scenes Kristi
im sure its a very busy email box happy he saw it
his bio says email for bookings
its in his bio
Ummmmm worst parent ever
hahahahahaha
Id take a humper over a sitter any day
Its for humping
Its not even what the stool is for
To think you have that kind of hold over the room
If your legs are tired just lean against the wall
Truly the gall of an open micer who sits down during their set
Its offensive to think you get to sit down
Ban all stool sitters
How did coles get his email address
oy
"Can u guys send me your favorite Spotify playlists  

Im back on it"
Only thing I run to is the polls

Tbh you were the impetus for wanting to screen since you havent seen so basically you can pick the time
I got stuff I gotta do but if I can make it work and it were late enough Id be game
What time were you thinking
Okay I asked the other day but it might have gotten buried Would Saturday work for a MacGruber screening for anyone Or should I try a different day
True thank you
He probably thought it was funny
I feel kinda guilty Whats the best way to feel better about this

But skeptically
Ill continue watching
Theres something VERY fishy about this
Stop being so charming
Manipulative and charming
I wish he didnt do that because a show rec from cam is usually great but rn its a prank probably
This is all very Lestat of you
This is what he said he was going to say while laughing about you falling for his stuff
Richie i dont like joking around about this because nobody ever follows through on my show recs and the fact that john is watching this means so much to me
I was like thats not nice but cam kept saying I dont care about Johns time Im evil
At small bar cam was laughing so hard saying John is going to be watching this bi show but its actually very average
Its just such an incredible show
Lestat is very bi but also very abusive
johncrete  im sorry if i promised more bi
Ok there has been ONE bi interaction so far among many gay interactions in interview with a vampire
Yes
Are people still at Small Bar
Its not like a traditional place by any means but just v solid and nice and not too expensive
Weve only been once but Saba on Milwaukee

I think Kerry should get the meat grinder but idk I guess I just listen to women
""
See Im just here to back up Chet
No no no no no You can just get them to do it for free
look at this beauty
also I used to work at a meat counter and we had to clean the grinder between each different meat so if someone came in with deer meat to grind Id be kind of annoyed lol
you dont understand I want to buy the meat grinder
No need to buy a meat grinder
If you ask the meat counter at the deli I think theyll do it for you
I was thinking shepherds pie bc thats the only way Ive had venison before but also it means I would have an excuse to buy the meat grinder attachment for my stand mixer lol
what should I do with it
Its so good
Deer meat rocks
was given fresh deer meat at the polka night afters

I should emphasize I only want to go with people that are also going to be horny for all the actors in it
Giantspeak be like
Like crazy shes making significantly less
This woman is a para professional but basically foes the same job as me
But ya idk that was my big takeaway Im left thinking about is how could we make here more like over there
Thats not to say we as a people dont also have a greater culture where we treat teachers and service industry and retail like shit
That was the biggest takeaway from Japan for me is how blatantly better off everyone seemed to be there and how that highlights just how bad and worse people are treated here
Yeah man its really wretched
Like how sad someone that also works at a public school has a second job 
from a woman
I just bought fries at Popeyes from I work with Ive never felt worse about this country
Unfortunately i cannot see g tomorrow
You can really tell i watched a youtube video

Thanks for letting us know about things being fucked we care and shit
You are very easy to interact with
Overwhelming and unnecessary 
ive just had so much conflict this last month it really broke me tbh
i think hes always been bad but its gotten exponentially worse and i tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and was real with him and he freaked out on me
So glad to hear this
I would have the same reaction
"just took
a second for me to come forward with because i used to be friends w him tbh and it just made me anxious and sad"
victoria had my back and so did the bar
Too tired for this
Neighbor fucking 
Bad guy

UGH

Youre managing a lot at once and doing a good job sorry he has severe brain damage that hes making other peoples problem
You deserve help from the other host and the bar on this its not fair for you to have this all on you

Coles host is literally the front lines

Such a creep

I saw an outback steakhouse in Japan
Where are business trip executives supposed to get an affordable yet appetizing meal
The outback steakhouse near OHare closed 
Dont talk to me until Ive had unsending a   
We can do a merger with the megalopolis one
Can we do a Japanese groupchat
Being called Aaron sama feels so good
they stayed for Cameronsan
They came for Saku
Kramer manga
The Japanese famously love laugh factory style comics
This is very unusual
Ok now it sounds like I think they normally get a Japanese audience
Ive never been more upset after a good set
And i feel a deep loss that had i known that it would have been the best set of my life to adult play with that
But also i only learned afterwards that a lot of japanese people were using google translate on their phones to understand the sets
It was so fun
Love it when that happens
Laugh Factory had a Japanese audience tonight huh
how did the set go
The japanese people adore me

Pretzel  cat

Truly incredible
Its easy to forget these things
its freaking awesome up here
Me in first grade after watching happy feet
Glad you told us dude also sorry youre dealing with this
""
But youre responseaction is totally understandable and you can always share stuff like this in the chat
You could try reaching out to Sophie Biddle Not sure if that would also put u in a dont shoot the messenger type situation
Fuck Brian hicks and fuck zanies and fuck Fiji water
ugh that sucks dude im so sorry
I was even nervous to post it in the chat honestly
like yeah he probably wouldnt even get a slap on the wrist
i wonder what would even happen if u just like posted that DM online
no literally
I know and its that shitty thing where Im kind of ashamed of myself for letting it happen but also I dont want to kneecap myself for nothing
i get keepin chill for ur career it just sUCKS thats such an annoying dm
ugh i know ur right im just like god damn i wish they would get put on blast
Hes in charge
or a random
is brian the guy in charge there
But like what would change Who would care Id just get blacklisted there
Also he couldve just said we already booked a host he didnt have to explain that its because youre a woman
idk megan i feel like you could literally put him on blast rn
Im fat as hell 
Hes so likeable women relate to him too
Peyton is really kind of an everywoman not just an everyman
is brian the booker guy
wait nvm zanies
what venue is this
oh my god hahaha
He had Peyton Ruddy host for Steph Tolev last year
it was me
I am certain the man he chose will be wildly out of place and not vibe with the crowd at all
He wanted to make sure we knew this is Trumps America now
Why not just say you already have a host
Yeah theres literally nothing you could say that wouldnt just cement his decision that sucks
Hahahahahahahahaha
This is for Sophie Biddle I dont think her fans are begging for male voices
Watching the crowd slowly get confused and angry when they realize they dont get to hear a man speak for once
You know what women love Slumber party vibes
So I cant make a scene
What is this a woman themed show
And Im such a shill I just gave a thumbs up because tragically I do still want to work there
The human mind simply cannot comprehend three women on a show
And the male feature that was booked simply didnt show up
Had to watch Ralphie Roberts do a set about trying to get laid and also being married for  years
Also explains why I only ever host for male headliners who guess what dont really care for my vibe
Im gonna burn that place to the ground what the hell
I want to just send this in response
There are allmale host feature headliner shows all of the time
INSANE reasoning

Horse rug chat
We were so close to all having horse rugs
Yeah but he could never best the might of American industry
This was when medieval Europe was mad weak and stretched thin
He got to the borders
Dude ghengis khan was about to take over Europe but then he died
China really slaps them around these days
Chet hanks favorite country is Mongolia
dont tell anyone I told you
Its actually where Gehghis Kahn is buried
I see nothing wrong with what Joey said
Yeah so at least  of people
I wish the pergola did more to celebrate the Mongolian empire
The horse rug will be my pergola
My current rug got ruined 
Its less flooded but theyre still working on it
that depends on if your apartment is still flooded
Do you guys think I should buy this horse rug
Im sitting next to a lady at a coffee shop whos trying to sell a Tesla over the phone
Aaron Klopfer We have not
I would never purchase a woman They are people and not property Aaron
Women are  of all purchases
Cameron Gillette did you and da girl text yet 
Pickme lotion 
jr bacon CEO
Lotion for men for women is such a good idea
women are at least  of the market
I have been toying with this concept what if we also sold products to women
If you dont have a result its bc youre still searching for the best way that something can be done
Saying that you want to search or investigate is great bc it sounds smart but it never promises and end result
Layout a plan for a rival and better company
and everyone can take turns being gay or straight
In five years I hope theyll have figured out conversion therapy
You should say you want to investigate ways to innovate the way your job is done
ooh I love that
no I leave the lotion sales to more qualified people I just help the guys who already bought the lotion
In five years you see yourself settling down with a wife and kids You hope to have climbed the ladder enough to provide a comfortable suburban living for your wife and beautiful daughter
What is ur job Lotion salesman
Yeah  year plans are bs you just gotta find a way to write some goals that dont make it seem like you a promising to do more or deliver higher quality work
Aspirational but non threatening
this reminds of the religion classes I had to take in grade school
Say you wanna be CEO jr
whats the kind of five year plan that the worlds dumbest ceo might like to see

i was gonna make a joke about speed but you beat me to it guess they call that slow joking 
I sorta mightve It was more fun than i thought it would be
Did you meet anyone
Who was the fastest
Very fun speed dating night with klopf
I had to explain to everyone at speed dating that i wrote straightish because i wouldnt go to a thing like that to meet men
Some people drove three hours to do  minutes
So today there were  comics and everyone got  minutes
The mic in Charlottesville does this crazy thing where instead of capping sign ups they adjust the amount of time everyone gets
Put him in here
And found out he works at the winery Im starting work at on Wednesday 
Just got unsolicited advice from an unfunny dude at an open mic 
We both cumd
Me and cam went speed dating
that place was special
thats how i feel about it
Frankly I can drive just fine as long as I dont get caught
Its only come up once in like  years for me
Ok thank you thats huge
The cycle continues
Lmao it was the previous tenant
when I was living there we actually did get a rock thrown through our window 
Rock window
and not a door I can directly knock on
theres not a doorbell for that apartment
Ring door
Imo just go to old address in person
but like I literally sent a letter to my old address and tried getting in touch with my old landlord and have heard nothing so I think o have to just declare it loststolen
I tried to renew via the kiosk and they sent that one to the wrong address and I havent been able to get in touch with the people who live there now and the woman at the dmv right now kept being like I cant issue you a new ID you need to go claim the ID because your identity is floating around and someone could take that ID and throw it in a crime scene then theyd blame you for the crime
THE WORLD IS RUN BY LANDLORDS AND FOSSIL FUELS LIBS 
Chat thought they could just ride bikes the rest of their lives
Looooool
I am currently in drivers license bureaucracy hell right now so this is close to mind 
they release the appointments at am everyday so you have to wake up early to book
Might have been because PA doesnt make you take drivers ed
I had to take a written test when moved from PA to get an IL license
If you just have a state ID and not a license
Looooool you might have to do a road test
God Im just imagining the child like falling off the foot thing and flailing around
Thats so funny
Hahahahahaha
cant stop cracking up at this
Or Im sure someone on reddit has had the same problem
Give a call and explain ur situation and ask what all will be needed from you
Ok yeah IDK how that all is gonna work out
Whats the matter with you
U just have an IL ID
Ive never had a license in Illinois
I think u can do online if ur at the same address as your prior license
Personally it would be very convenient if I could just grab one next week
Politically i think drivers test should be stringent bc we dont do enough to recognize that these things are death machines that cause millions of deaths every year
But everything online is just if youre over  just show up and pay 
I think they just check youre vision
I havent had to do a road test since ever
I surrendered my Wisconsin license five years ago to get an IL ID so Im like wont I have to do a road test again
I dont think it took me more than an hour overall besides traveling there and back but its hard to say bc I also got lunch after
Show up with proof of residency and whatever else Id you need
Go to the one in Chinatown on a weekday before noon
I think when I converted to MN to Illinois I just walked up too
I had to renew mine bc of an address change and I just went
No
Do u have an il license already
Did you have to take tests
All the Chicago places say no available appointments so Im like do I just walk in with all the ids like lemme drive a car
Gotta use crypto forms and lib bucks to fill out your government freedom form
Were in the future now
Sorry boomer
When we went home earlier this year Rebeccas dad was annoyed that this government agency he was working with wouldnt take a physically mailed in form
Its sick
Everything is like online now
Honestly navigating government bureaucracy has never felt easier
After I showed two forms or whatever
I think you have to make an appt now but when I did it I walked in and they were like here you go
Yeah I have
Hey next Monday is Karis bday and she is having a lil get together at small bar at pm if anyone will be free and wanna meet up

Then for reality below deck med healed me post breakup
also im on kms avenue
Also only murders in the building is good sick day vibes
I Said it privately but bad sisters is very good
Just objectively not good jokes
Its tough when you know the jokes are bad
Man I couldnt last even like a minute in
Theyre all just so selfish and petty it rocks
its literally what if West Wing was good
Sorkin could never
I like how only some of the characters are actually clever and most are just dumb
that was a huge relief
will update my veep journey
im so glad we figured out what im watching tho thanks guys
Some of the richard splett stuff of the funniest shit Ive ever seen on tv
this is my new binge
I think the finale is my favorite tv episode
Its SOOOO good
Veep is so rewatchable bc I never remember all the mean little things they say so they always catch me by surprise
Jesus Christ this is from when I like just moved to Chicago
also girl ofc ive seen salt lake city
Like its fictionalized but it is based on somewhat real things that go on
Penn State has literally been taken over by high rise buildings its insane

no ill take another whack i guess
But hey if you dont like it you dont like it
""

Its kind of jarring at first but you gotta power through it
idk just spitballing
maybe you are small minded and weak
ok why cant i get into it
like i want to feel like im thinking
Well have you watched succession yet Ive been thinking of running through that again
Oh nvm

It is good
Otherwise the only things I ever watch are star trek and sopranos lol
no i want something thats like Good
Real life Truman show
Great british bake off is good for turning off your brain too
Secret lives of Mormon wives also very good
Honestly if you want to just completely rot and binge something insane real housewives of salt lake is pretty wild if you can stomach it
joey

u have to watch white lotus
Oh white lotus slaps
The contestant on Hulu
so that the next time Im sick I can finally start white lotus or whatever

jesus christ thats bleak
Those kids will look back in  years and be proud that they stood for something
Like just imagine for one second we live in that world
Can you imagine if the they sent in the national guard in to beat the fuck out of these kids for doing this like they did for the free palestine kids at Columbia
I had to file medical paperwork so I can be visibly depressed at work without being reprimanded
i had to babysit a DJ that was in a k hole during my brunch shift at stay cafe
yeah havent u done weird shit for trader joes
Yeah I guess
having extreme existential dread
I just dont think I can hide my contempt for an hour
Its pretty legal to make your employees do a bunch of weird stuff
he  voted for Trump
the day after the election he came into the office and sang  little birds to everyone
Neither of those are fair to ask
How is this even legal Im not trying to do a bit

Thank you
That is a consolation
Well if its any consolation I just applied to a Christian tech start up who are working on a new prayerspirituality app
Ive just kinda learned how to skim
i dont get how people handle the machete chris responses i would kms
like ive been avoiding ever asking to do  a show for  years now
i just dont have enough good mental health to submit to stuff in general hahaha
So even if u dont get booked right away it would get you in the process to get booked v quickly
Seems like he sends that as a default but then books those people before you know it
but i am gonna just bite the bullett and submit today
i am so scared to submit to paper machete bc idk if my brain can take a novel response to why its just not the right time for me
Yeah he keeps talking about it Im gonna ignore
Like that feels like something micropeens get off on
I honestly think he only responded because he wanted you to ask to see it
Yeah im gonna get called a micropenis hating bitch
When can we have a pergola party
"Itll be like
Hey 
Hey
I knew u were a bitch
Hey"
This is the kind of dude that will call you a bitch when you stop responding

But pls do not come until 
 w Logan Blvd
Whats your address again Ian
Hmmm 
I have a theory that my dick gonna merge in ur mouth
Only to start the cycle all over again
I have a theory that group chats expand continuously until they merge into one super massive group chat consuming all other groups chats and spinning wildly out of control until it disperses scattering its members into incalculable other smaller groups chats
""
I love it
good job aaron
wait this post in general is so insane hahaha
Leave it
Should I delete
Otherwise I yield to him
If theres enough for me and Joey
Ty
Yeah
Men be like astrology is gay then post memes like this about their groupchats
Ill bring some theyre in chocolate form
Skipping my birthday for Megalopolis round 
Can I also drink
Yeah
I mean
Im not drinking currently but does anyone want to do shrooms with me tonight
The center is asmus
The circles are group chats
Ikagi
Chicago comedy
Jack rocks
My king of kings
It was like hey sick to see you And then kinda fizzled
i dont know what i did before this group chat
Andrew and I ran into Jack at a show here
Because he showed me a meme Jack made about Laughable News
Im guessing Ricardo too
I think Knute is in the Jack Allen one
Life is so beautiful Everyone has their little group chats
Wait who is in that one
One time Jack Allen was telling me about his group chat and I was just like I cant imagine
A sit down with the five families
Theres probably like  group chats and Laughable News is getting posted in all of them
Yalta Confrence of Chicago comedy
You cant ban queer joy thats what I always say
thats for the queer chat
my queer joy is none of ur business
Coward
Well they have the signs up there to say not to do that
u know what im gonna delete that one
Hahahahahahahah
Hahahaha
hate that place
Green eyes
Drink a cold one at the bowling alley in a Jersey
asmus
where do danny and i go for a nice cold one rn
His name is Geoff Asmus
Sure they do
they dont have a chat baby either
sorry im drinking a beer
I dont think their chat plans hangs
should i wear a jersey or a white sox shirt to go bowling
Sorry Ive had  beer
RESPECTFULLY
Thats the clear rd
Ive been saying basketball game
so i think we should have a chat conference party
and then colin ungers chat also has the same people they shit talk
What can I say I love to bet on the ponies
yes we did go over all the same people we shit talk
Im in both chats and we make fun of the exact same people in both but the other one talks about gambling more
horrible ratio i had to send them an excel spreadsheet with all the women they could add in
Yeah whats the gender ratio in the main chat 
That being said Happy birthday to Mitchell 
And I love Hunter but of course he wants an all male chat
Youre our Snowden
devastating
and hunter went to shanker oh damn dude ur in THE MAIN chat
and shanker named off everyone in his
and i named off everyone in this one
was w hunter hirsch and max shanker last night and we were talking about our respective group chats
HAPPY BDAY MITCHELL
Im sure theyll have the main fight going on on the first floor
Well how about if anyone wants to have a beer before Mitchs and watch some amateur boxing fights  theyre welcome to come over around  and then we can carpool over to schubas around 
Damn
That would be my guess  fights that start at  pm Not sure how long those first three will go but Ive gotta assume at least an hour
Well thats gonna cut into our beautiful Mitchell time
 eastern
So the Tyson Paul fight probably wont go on until like 
Ya I wanna try to quick go to the gym before how about folks start showing up around ish
Of da Paul Tyson rounds
Could at least watch a couple rounds
If Jake Paul wins Im burning the pergola down
Also I think I can have a few folks over before Mitchs to watch the fight just react to this if you wanna come over before
It was nice seeing u at schubas I hope u have a great night
Yoo happy birthday Mitchell
I just want to reiterate happy birthday Mitchell Potts
Think like when SpongeBob faced off with King Neptune on cooking burgers but take out the spatulas and theyre touching
Unfortunately I only know how to explain this competition in terms of hamburgers
Im not sure
So its like Joey Chesnut vs Kobayashi but instead of hot dogs its punches
Its gonna be a Dave chappelle special
Which I feel is a big get
Its actually on Netflix
Blood sports are always pulling that shit
Is the fight not pay per view
Ya lemme circle back later I wanna run it by Kari otherwise we can meet at a bar or something
Your place
Wanna watch with your cats
Wait you prob miss your cats
Crowds suck tho
Johns place it is
It also might make sense to go to a bar close to schubas I feel like theyll drag the fight out with preliminarily fights
Aarons place is further from schubas than your place Ian
Lemme circle back closer to game time
Wicker
Wheres ur place with respect to schubas
We can also go to a bar or something nearby schubas thats playing it
My place or ur place Ian Erickson
Share if u agree
Very disappointed
I cant go to Mitchells tonight though unfortunately Im going to a surprise party for Julia
Maybe yeah
Oh maan
Anyone wanna pregame Mitchs and watch the Paul  Tyson fight
Thank you guys
Happy birthday Mitchell
We love Mitchie  Happy birthday Mitchie 
Oh hell yeah Cant wait to see everyone Gonna be a fun night
Happy birthday mitchie See ya at schubas
Oh hell yeah
I cant wait to go to Schubas to celebrate with all my friends
Thank you

Then she told me to be a man and stand on my own feet and I got to say I cant Im on crutches
A tenant who is pretty insane that screams every time she comes into our office was like they cant fire you why are you scared of them When I told her I wouldnt do something for her and I had to be like absolutely they can

But dumb as dirt
My neighbors dad loved me because I was big I was like Sam
Never was me

I still remember my friends mom being audibly shocked when she found out I had the best grades in my class in middle school
His answering machine bit was crushing last night
Me and stock well keep doing the fresh faces show together

The cats favorite food is pasta
Kid I volunteer with drew me this
A kid got in trouble during a fire drill today because he kept screaming that he was being kidnapped and a woman across the street waiting for the bus started filming lol
so weirdly it was news
it wasnt laughable but I genuinely did learn something from the Uranus video
Thanks Brian
I still need to watch that one
just him pronouncing Uranus not a joke in sight

Ian after returning from Japan
followed through on this
can we protest with FREE ZAKO signs
I was GLUED to my phone
it was probably my fav day in the group chat
Laugh all you want before I die Im getting an EGGOT
i wanna go this year
Everyone is right though
And that was one of the funniest things Ive ever seen
Ill always have a soft spot for the Gazellies because it gave the world the ZakoMack fight
i cant believe we have gun and gazelle also has fun
Its astonishing how many comedians cant understand joking
Sort of a who is this for Kinda thing
Gazelles are very similar to when a college theatre department does its own award show
maybe we will be ok
i did find out all of the people we shit talk in this group chat are also mentioned in another group chat
EXACTLY
people always jump to the defense of jerry and the gazelle bc theyre putting on good shows or whatever but its like cant a guy just make fun of someone for doing something dweeby anymore
yes
This would be so funny
Lets give Blake burkhardt rookie of the year
Is there not a cunty award this year
We can all put you for Most Improved
Or is that a bit that can only result in me having to go to the Gazellies
Should I campaign super hard for a Gazellie
""
Ians BACK
aaron  likes klopfer set the nickname for Kristi Durkin to didnt mean to change name sry
Japan was great but its good to be home
aaron  likes klopfer set the nickname for Kristi Durkin to sasa
Could we all hold hands there
Im being sober and that sounds like the perfect environment
wait we should make a good form to attend a bender
hahahahHA
We could do a chat trip to go see them every single night
its kinda cool in the sense thats its like tour but every night u get to go home to ur gf kristi
I wouldnt do it unless it paid enough to take more than a month off
im like feeling happy but conflicted about it for him lol
no days off
Might genuinely cause an injury
It would definitely be kind of cool to get that many reps in but no breaks at all is nuts
Wait like no days off
but its like theres never a Good month to do a show everyday i guess
the drama is that we were gonna go on a family trip and i was gonna film my special the month they asked
hAHAHA
wait i just got booked on some barstool show
Honestly could be an incredible creative process
Yeah there is no parking or bike parking over there That is an insane offer in general Liars Club is the new Vegas
That feels like durational performance art
and i dont fuck w the regulars but i do like the venue
Its really in a fucked up random part of Fullerton theres like nothing around it for two blocks
they have weird regulars
its like i like it but im like jesus everyday at liars club sounds like a lot
Man Ive always wanted to see what that place is like on the inside Ive gone by it so many times
its ALWAYS like that
lol phylyzzz just got asked to do a month long residency for liars club where they would play everyday for  days
Couldnt find my cat for like  mins and was frantically searching around having a minor panic attack and then when I finally found her under the couch she was looking at me like this
EXACTLY
I never hear of these guys until theyre the most influential thing on the internet
also i think i dont realize how big he is bc i never really looked him up bc the vibe seemed off
idk i totally agree it sucks but im like god damn i have to book people every week and now i have assassinate kill tony
a cumtown residency is a cumtown residency
Humiliating
Like imagine liking the president
Last thought is that they feed off of feeling like theyre edgy and counter cultural but guess what trump won the popular vote thats your guy
if this is your attempt to get crushes to stop booking nick mullen it will not work
If you could go back in time would you kill baby Bob keen
Exactly Im saving their lives
What are you stopping them from doing Most of the Kill Tony heads are dogshit at comedy and dont do anything besides the worst open mics imaginable
When actually its so lame
I just think you run the risk of making it seem cool
The next Rogan will be Shanklands fault
I cant stop joe Rogan but Ive met a lot of guys that I probably could have
I just think about the open micers that are like oh I like kill tony and maybe I could have done a better job explaining why I think its bad to them
I think at a local level its important to call out people when they buy into that shit and not fuck w them
I think you need to mock them more than anything
THANK YOU
I do think Bruce is right tho
Yeah and I think the new ones are going to be floating around the orbit if what already exists
Those guys are too big to stop but there are new ones started every day
Obviously Im thinking beyond what reality is right now but Im trying to think what are the steps we can take
Because younger comedians arent going to see these platforms as a route to success if using kill Tony as a credit can get you blacklisted
Instead we should say Joe Rogan makes a quarter million from Spotify and makes consequential presidential endorsements so he doesnt get to do the Im just a stoner idiot dont listen to me act
Im thinking live standup yeah
I mean yeah if youre talking live standup but that isnt really the problem imo
If clubs and producers stopped booking them
I think the approach is to treat them the way they treat mainstream press
What are you gonna exclude them from were talking about the biggest podcasts in the world by far
Yeah its a real problem Especially on twitter where people will retweet anything they hate to be like this is bad and end up just giving people a bigger platform and help them gain an audience
They are the platforms
No were past that point
Like people are always saying they suck but I think there probably needs to be more of an effort to not platform these kinds of people and the people that support them
And the Joe Rogans etc etc
Im reading the antifa handbook and Im starting to think maybe we arent harsh enough when we talk about the kill Tonys and legions of skanks of the world
johncrete what movie did you see
the way im so there
I love a beautiful birthday
exactly
Its actually so important to remember that mitchell is having a bday party at schubas on this upcoming friday  were all invited
This poll is no longer available
Whoa
 
does everyone know mitchell is having a bday party at schubas on this upcoming friday  youre all invited  midnight we rented the upstairs  
yes
You dont bring that up nearly enough
When I was Val Kilmers assistant he was doing a one man show and the other assistant had to be the audience plant for every show
Right now Nick Fuentes could be listening to boygenius and wed all be at brunch
Shankland doing what Kanye couldnt
You could have instilled in him a love of music
Just audience plants
He graduated the year before I got there but I would have had him
Nick Fuentes was a student at the school I student taught at
Hes been around he was on Kanyes campaign staff
And it turns out he lives in his mothers basement in berwyn
A far right dickhead made a video gloating about women losing rights
Has anyone seen the nick Fuentes stuff
Burn
My mom
Does anyone know about plants

Bail
Dude yeah fuck that
For how it is in general i feel like it has the most touristy crowds out of the clubs
Oof thats creepy
Theyve asked me out line three times
Also honestly Im  sure the person that booked me only booked me because theyre trying to sleep with me
I dont care if I bomb
I mean in the sense that management is awful
Also who knows maybe it got better
You cant protect yourself from everything and still learn lessons
I say experience it and decide
I got booked on a show there tomorrow and Im trying to decide if I should bail
You guys how bad is comedy bar
You should it was an awesome idea
no worries
Anyone wanna go dancing Saturday btw
Its such a fun kinda show to produce
Hollywood Illinois
When I get back from Japan Im starting my video show again 
Truly she was slumming it at CrushXCrushWest

I left a little after it bc was tired from driving but good vibes
Kinda insane how good Clares video was
Suckn my own dick at midnight
it was starting to feel too much like lolla
I think its canceled because I dont think anything good is going to happen again
Just perfectly in the way
Those dumb vip booths wrecked the vibe
and also the lineup this year was lame
honestly pitchfork has gotten to be too much
In their reviews
Pitchfork is about to start using the r word
I just think thats an attempt to soften the blow
watch them move it to austin
yeah and saying we will not stop hosting events
I just feel like its so specifically like were not doing it in Chicago and we have made the difficult decision not to host Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago sounds like its gonna be somewhere else
Like I dont think moving it to Gary Indiana or whatever would make it more profitable
Yeah youre probably right
I dont interpret that as were going to have it somewhere else
I mean theres European pfk fests that are wayy smaller which is maybe what they mean by continue to produce events
Yeah its GQs fault gays and queers
Whoa whoa whoa lets not go that far
wait thats so gay
Man fuck GQ
Looks like it might just be moving cities which is DUMB
What
Pitchfork fest done for good 
and i just am like man maybe just close friends at lake house would be so sweetie
i feel like every year i try to either throw or go to a massive house party
FUCK ALL THEM THO

My favorite part of eat pray love is when she spies on her neighbors
Klopfer you should buy a bunch of vape cartridges for  and then resell them to your Trader Joes coworkers for  a pop
Eating fudge praying no one sees your motel telescope and loving every minute of it
Building a telescope in a motel room feels so wrong

Truly one of the funniest things Ive ever seen
Sam when you played soccer and fell only to somersault and spring back on your feet
im sure theyre friends but it is truly so funny to hear geoff asmus get name dropped while im waiting on a line cook to drop a rueben
he keeps talking to the  year old food runner about asmus
Hahahahahaha
hahahahaahahahahahahahaha
He played soccer with us once and he got a yellow card because he purposely slide tackled someone and in the  seasons Id played no one had even gotten carded
Hey Joey I think this was a good riff that people didnt respect enough
Gonna get him pregnant some day God willing
I love that bitch
She had been on my show like two weeks prior
One time in that side area at LF tiny was giving comics hugs next to me and I thought she said hi to me so I gave her a hug too and then she goes are you a comic or something
I went to high school w a guy named Tiny Thickemz Think hes in real estate in West Allis now

Everyone was talking about big game
Then its basketball season

Unfortunately it seems so
Is basketball season over
Would anyone be interested in a diner breakfast tomorrow
Im gonna have another Christmas party gang Trying to decide on a date heart this for  and thumbs up for

If Ive learned anything its that club owners know exactly what makes comedians funny
LOL
CJ is popular on twitter and has some writing credits now I think
Cj is a good comic that used to live here
Jamie masada is the founder of laugh factory like above curtis
Why does anyone try to put their finger on the scale
Also I dont understand shit like this lol
Who is Jamie Masada and CJ Toledano
I guess its not great tea but jamie masada really wants chris bader to be a thing
Way back in the day when cj toledano lived here jamie masada tried to get cj to write jokes for chris
A little tea i know about chris
Really
I have never seen that dude show up for a spot Hes on so many posters and then just doesnt go
At least a once a week performer at LF
Hes like the kind of dude laugh factory books CONSTANTLY
Me Im more of a guy on  shows type of guy
Oh gotcha
Kind of a laugh factory Zanies comedy bar and road guy
Ive never heard of that guy is he never Or just like a laugh factory guy
And he sucks so bad
Laugh Factory just throws him on everything

UGH MAKE LANDLORDS GREAT AGAIN

Trump is gonna make it illegal to be mean to landlords
What Im really worried about too with trump being elected is that mortgage rates will go up and I wont be able to refinance by May like I wanted

I may even have to increase rent if I cant refinance this year
Honestly probs not

But I know its there to heal me
Man pulling a scab off is so satisfying
Might try yoga w Adrienne now this bitch sounds cool

Nice
hes shooting his own short
Plester
and i had to be like hey thats sick but i want actual good footage girl what r u doin
my producer is like cool but too cool and thinks we can film this on only a camcorder
im scared
hahahaahhaahahah
I thiiiiink I know how hell film itbegrudgingly 
ooooo good idea
Tbh Derek
on a handheld preferably
who would yall recommend for a person to film a show
he opened up his set last night being like i lost a bet if trump won i would have ti get into ventriloquism
The last time I saw him rap at Coles it made me laugh so hard
does anyone have his number
He fucking rules
its okay when i do it
Now that Kristi is the host I realize that its actually a very just system
I thought the bumping at Coles was so unfair when I first started here
hes getting into ventriloquism
haahahHAH i love him so much
Erik West would get vouched so hard
Three months in youre already addicted to this bs
what is coles if i cant let joey walk in and do a set
all i do is bump
Erik West can be the one guy you bump in
and its like no bumping
thats so true
I think the pm crowd is probably exactly the group that is monitoring the vouch shows
hahaHAHA
how will erik west find out he doesnt have a computer
But the mic was a pretty decent vibe
Well the word would spread
idk
yeah like is it fair to throw this new format in for the people who come every week at like  pm and wait
Didnt mean to send that
""
Yeah I will say when I did the one at Lotties there werent very many Coles regulars
i dont want to screw over our regulars
yes but just coles style dont be a weirdo and change our format
maybe ill tell them yet but no lotto
yeah also i dont want to do lotto
Yeah its a lotto of  people upton
And a different sign up process I guess since I think they do lotto
Itll just be a different  open micers
its def not gonna like help coles
and yeah sometimes nights at coles are slow but idgaf its mainly  comics every week and a really long gig
no literally i get the same paycheck so idc
Frankly all youre signing up for is a longer night of hosting Youre doing him the favor
but when my friends get it thats fun no shade
Yeah if its we need to now now then the answer is no
and gay even
but its coming off not cool
ultimately i think its a good idea for the scene
EXACTLY
CYSK speedrun
Going in with that attitude of you should be honored to be asked and dont expect me to be organized or respectful of your time is just replicating the rotten culture
Idk I can see the value in something like that conceptually but it only works if you have some humility
That makes it easy imo
and he was like well no its important i go home tonight with an answer
but yeah really up to you guys
and i was like hey you never reached out to me i need a second
I feel like honestly theres plenty of slow nights at coles anyway so it wouldnt hurt to make one of em for vouch
yes
Wait this was in person
idc that much i dont like that he was like cornering me as i was trying to set up saying he needed to know Now
i personally dont see it at coles but idc too much
Will doing it at coles just alienate the audience of normal attendees that already come on a regular basis
does coles benefit
My only thought on them asking to do it at coles is why coles
I think thats just the only way to present it
Even if theyre fuckin dorks about it being like an honor or some shit
Consider the way that organizations raise money for specific causes People always make the argument of like people will donate to the cause anyway but I think ultimately formalizing the process and stirring up publicity results in a more accountable experience and forces the process of bookers booking people
i think the purpose to get people booked is genuinely good but this process is a little redundant and a jack off no
to do other shows
and then the show is an audition
So thats how it works logistically
I did one of the mics and basically they just draw  people at the beginning of the mic to do  minutes as an audition for the show
like why doesnt chris trani just come see an open mic and ask people himself
it seems a little self important
I do think what theyre doing is a genuinely positive move for the community though
he didnt like that i didnt know him
Brandon is a sloppy person
lol
and i was like ahhhh what hahaha
and hes like well we need to know Now
brandon was like hey victoria hasnt responded to me so i showed up where is she and i was like shes in madison
they asked to do coles and idk if i like their vibe
ok ill bite whats the deal w vouch
i dont girl im sorry

CHAOS BRINGS THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER
Feeling amazing running into John stockwell tonight in the middle of the street in front of his house because somebody was drunk driving  and rammed their car into a bunch of cars on his street like  minutes before Derek and I biked by from a late showing of smile  where we got way too drunk and way too scared and thought we were still in the movie a little bit
Explain
yeah basically
hows morale
not bad tbh
Is he the new moral center of Coles open mic How are the vibes there
i like christian royce now
Kristi is saving the world rn
Yeah I immediately regretted that as soon as I sent it
and this is what I come back to
I go to Japan for TWO WEEKS
Please Ian I know times are difficult but we cant blame Japanese beetlejuice
I cant help but feel Japanese Beatlejuice shoulders some blame here
When we needed you the most you went to Super Mario World
Its a shame America cant hear poopfucker tonight
Gonna figure out the joke that will fix America on the way
Gonna head up to Coles in a few
Are you in touch with IWW
In a groupchat with workers who wanna unionize but our store hasnt yet
Is there a union person you can talk to
I dont know how to explain it its so convoluted and fucked
The hours I needed to go towards my adafmla thing were cut down because I was on leave of absence for injuries
Does this make sense
"So I was enrolled also in an ada thing did that so I couldnt get reprimanded for looking like Im not having fun at work

That gave me two call offs a month Those absences go towards insurance hours

I was banking on those to go towards my insurance qualification

Theyre just now telling me I havent worked enough to qualify for that kind of thing so I cant account for those absences"
Idk how fmla works but getting injured and taking a little off seems pretty obvious and standard right
Im ready
Need more incentive for a change
ugh dude im so sorry thats horrible
Losing my insurance in December bc I didnt work enough bc of my injuries 
Put a gun range in the pergola
Shooting a gun is like being bisexual you really need to try it every few years just to check and see if your taste has changed and you like it now
Shankland is political enough that Id consider going
Same
Fucked of you to say because I do have my rifle merit badge
bc youd be the first guy we all turn against
Yeah and Id go with him
Aarons friend isnt in the chat to be fair
Absolutely going nowhere near a gun range with anyone in this chat
ive shot rifles with my dad before
I love shooting guns
Just honked at a coworker for trying to be cutesy with me while I sit in my car for my break
""
He has a lot of guns and good vibes
He would be down
I have a buddy who is an ex marine
anyone going to this
That man looks like he owned guns off the record as well
Lmao Richies real estate developer good fella grandfather
Can I use this
Just found my grandpas gun license
Gun bad gun range fun
And when you hit the little can sitting on the fence Oh baby
Shooting a gun feels awesome tbh
No dog hate the dog is innocent
Also I used to work for West Virginias newest senator and I cant tell you how much I hate him and his dumbass dog
"chat trip to gun range 
"
You simply gotta try it
Its crazy some people in this chat havent shot a gun
If they dont pass they get sent to vibe camp
I would have a gun in a fun Charlies Angels kind of way
This country needs mandatory vibe checks
You pass the vibe check for one meg
idk I think Id be really good at gun
cant stop telling people about it
and unfortunatley it is the funniest thing ive ever read in my life
Some liberal white guy derek went to college with posted on facebook today that he wanted to learn how to shoot a gun because he was afraid for where the country was headed but a few weeks ago posted a  paragraph post about how being in las vegas was over stimulating
Good news Theyre sending the kid that bit me to a farm upstate with lots of space to run around with all the other kids that bit their teachers
There is still good in the world chat
Hahahaha
You think the uBreakiFix guys stole it
All my porn is gone tho
Got my phone fixed if you couldnt tell
There should be more imo
My own Twitter you might say
there are  people why not use it as a testing ground
A medium of my own creation
A writing exercise perhaps
This chat is simply a writing utility for my twisted little jokes
dont hide your light in the bushel of this chat
In this one rare instance John and I agree
Wanna host shit for dis cute little chat
We can also lip sync budd Dwyer etc
I have an amplified podium at my apartment if anyone wants to do a weird karaoke night
Coming from the chat heretic of course youd say that
I had strep the first time he won and now a knee injury Feels like this is my fault for not staying healthy
Nothing is sacred
I do this on almost a daily basis
Lol yeah well see not sure yet
I feel like most folks are tuned out of everything right now
I say post it if you feel like it
In a way the same thing
""
I see you as the chat grocery store owner
Im sort of a chat organizer
Chat is kind of the new community
Oh well then thats fine of course
But I did then use it and for that I apologize
Haha i made it before I sent it to chat
Chat is sacred
I dont like a chat joke getting posted dangerous precedent
Crisis averted
You know what Maybe Ill just not today
""
I think its funny but I dont want to post it if itll just bum people out you know
Like would people be upset

Chomsky changed me
Let me know how it is Ive never read kropotkin but Ive become anarchocurious
Felt like a bit of a rube paying for anarchist literature that is freely available online but wanted a nice physical copy to have and to hold
I just bought mutual aid by Peter kroptokin a couple weeks ago

Im going to read the Antifa handbook if anyone wants to boom club w me

They need to open an iO in Mississippi 
Im just saying I can marry whoever wants it
Sorry I wouldnt move to Canada
my stupid take is we need to mass exodus to red states
I will say that we had bag milk in elementary school in the states
Loving and strongly agreeing with this antimovetoCanada discourse its my least favorite whim of grown men
I picked an insane month to give up candy
should i delete

stockipiling assault rifles and fleshlights

southpark ass groupchat
They were sending indigenous kids to reeducation camps and burying them in unmarked graves well into the s so I really dont wanna hear about Canada right now
Its a fucking mining company that calls itself a country
i kno theyre mad racist and stupid too
I hate when canada acts all hoity toity in moments like this
the idf needs videographers
and they all want to move to canada
i told my gf that unfortunately the only foreign country we can legally move to rn is israel
brooo we already have gun

The most important thing anybody can do today is not post a promo for a comedy show with we all need some laughs
going to be honest dont get a gun
i been googling vasectomy and foid card stuff
My TikTok is full of women urging me to go b aka end dating so get your jokes out while you can
Thats the one thing I CAN promise right now
but Sam what if in Trumps America dating will no longer be weird
Its our duty to talk about how dating is weird
I disagree In this moment as comedians we HAVE to speak truth to power
Standup comedy seems pretty insane to do tonight but I also wouldnt mind hanging with some friends
Its upsetting and yet Kinda fun
But if anyone wants footage of me truly wrecking myself I will send it
Its not ideal Dont have health insurance so Im gonna get that and then get an MRI but urgent room doctor told me to give it a month and see if it heals on its own
Yes Not even kidding
Wait wtf are you
Soft tissue damage is not fun
Im sorry dude
im feelin like cancelling coles
""
Im Canadian so I can marry u all
Physically may have torn a ligament in my knee but mentally The same
How we feeling chat
All our friends at crushes this year
Followed by googling foid card stuff
Genuinely first instinct this morning
Idk why but I feel we should all start lifting weights
the becektt one
Thats actually the sweetest thing a cousin can say
my cousin who voted for trump first round then got lib brain washed texted me at  am saying shes so sorry this is happening and shes here for my queer ass
interview for my stupid email job got cancelled which like would have been really awkward to do today anyways
Thinking about the little boy who came trick or treating alone last week in small town West Michigan wearing a full suit and cardboard Trump mask and I actually screamed from fright and terror in his face he must be being a real piece of shit today at school
Guy on the train next to me watching avengers endgame on his phone
Is that why you left
Did you get medically locked in for a bit
What if we all moved to Japan
i tried mg adderall but the world needs me unfocused
Sure would be a shame if someone dusted the vents
Papa needs a new phone screen
Dust em up
Rent is going up this year
well yeah I guess both of them have dementia now
Im taking this loss out on my tenants
And misogynistic
Imo
The economy is a huge part but I think Americans are just xenophobic and homophobic to the point where theyll vote for a dementia devil
like Joe Biden had maybe the worst presidencies in history like I am not even convinced hes still alive
And peoples kids turning gay
I mean I think its like partially the thing of like anyone running against an unpopular incumbent is going to win and unfortunately this time that person was trump
I think the media isnt saying how much of it is Americans being scared of immigrants
But its also so marginal
Like sure presidents have some impact
It is just unbelievable that the fate of our country is left up to the arbitrary state of the economy
Fuck donald Trump man
Im so fucking pissed
My phone fell off my bed last night and the screen broke
She back
I missed Twyman contributing to da chat
"do you think America purposefully made Election Day on Tuesday bc they know the Coles mic is on Wednesday so we can all kind of go talk and joke about it the day after 
Kind of freaking awesome if they did"
Good thing you got the rabies shot
but something must be done about this kid
Trumps America smdh
sorry
hahahahahahah
Just got bit again
I wish high maintenance was still on so we could get another episode of all of Brooklyn finding out that donald trump is president
Apparently this is all over twitter so nevermind Im NOT FUNNY ANYMORE I was previously and it isnt debatable
Prop  passed in New York though so abortion is protected here One positive thing
This aint great
This is really bad obviously but it would be really funny if they had Maya Rudolph play Hallelujah like Kate McKinnon did
"in this house
guns are guns
were very curious what the data says
guns are real"
If anything pops off you are all welcome to join my strikeforce
Id go halvesies on one
Rule one was no making jokes about assassinating the president online tho 
I dont know but yeah a lot of them do
Like do I need to get a gun
Those guys are nuts
I looked into joining the socialist rifle association
Im guessing a lot of people just stayed home because the house and senate are also heavy Republican
Very curious to see what the data says
I just want to look at voting demographics but it wont really settled for a couple days
Its terrible
Damn she got cooked
Any news on if any of the local measures passed
They have the house and the senate too
Unbelievable
Yup so hes president again
He just won PA
Oh my god
So fucking annoying
Fuck man
This poll is no longer available

Im undecided 
libtards will see orange normal people will see red

yeah the president of voting the most
John would be president
Well you can call it right now if thats the case
angry emoji counts as  everything else is  vote
sorry I do that a lot
what if most of your messages are random and unrelated to what people are talking about
John heart reacts are  electoral
Are you determining winning by pure number of likes Or will there be a weighted likes per post
and this person will be our president
im downloading my data logs from the last  years and will let everyone know who won the chat so far
do you think theyre gonna let sarah squirm sing hallelujah as ella emhoff if kamala loses
Stay in line
Ok tessa and I are coming
Its busy but its not hard to get a drink or anything TV is too far away to feel overwhelmed but its nice
How is bottle is it still packed
Some of us are at pergola some are at the bottle
Where is everyone tn
Come on Harambe
And we have to count all the funny write in votes too one of those could win
And the cities that lean heavy blue take the longest to count
Remember that they have to count mail in ballots and it takes a while to do that
Just a reminder that this is the same thing that happened last election
Its really really really close
Ok Im gonna stop looking at the New York Times
Its looking insanely favorable
Oh trump is gonna win
Its crazy close rn in a couple different states its going to come down to mail ins
who does his lip fillers 
John u gotta  come here
no its bad
Ty
Ok
Its not bad
Can anyone smart tell me how bad the polls look now
Pergolection

Calling a Lyft to bottle rn
This is not an endorsement of Mike shorty shorten
I didnt even know about AM its like night time but not as fun
well what Im realizing is that I woke up at am today
This was the real ballot
Thats so sick you can put nicknames on ballots
Joey realllllly doesnt wanna raise money for Gaza
what if instead of Empty Bottle the great hang with all my friends happened tomorrow at coles
Not only was it funny but it was really smart
This is like Abbott and costello
Figured we could all use a laugh tonight
""
Shooting for 
probably later
I hate that vibe but Im willing to hang
Per empty bottle story they are gonna be showing results on the screen Also what time are people headed there
We should jam again sometime that was fun
I bet its pretty easy
So now Im going to learn it so he and I can be friends
Yesterday at work this Jamaican guy thought I said I can play No Woman No Cry and he was so disappointed when I said I couldnt
Also the  year old lady ended her  minute phone call with hope the election ends well and we dont get bombed
This is true Id buy face wash from anybody who was able to beat the laws of physics
And said that if we can invent cardboard that doesnt get wet everyone would buy our face wash
But he was bummed that the cardboard boxes we ship in lose from when they get wet
He was trying to buy cardboard boxes from us
Today at my customer service job one of the dumbest people Ive ever spoken to reminded me to get out and vote
Customer on the phone just said Im  years old and I do whatever the hell I want Just like Judge Judy
Unsure if you actually need to do it but I did just in case
There was a thing on their insta story for tickets which were 
in a major way
wait were having a hang
I might go as well
Yeah I was like why are people giving weird vibes about the empty bottle
hahaha wait that makes more sense
I think its also a fundraiser for Gaza
I will prob head to EB as well lmk when people are heading over
and then will probs head there after
im getting sushi san w my high school best friend who used to be a lesbian and went straight
I would have loved some rock and roll music but I might settle for hanging with friends
Eh I might come
but its simply just the bar is open
theyre just trying to get a crowd and saying election
no not at all
Ok but to be clear its not a show
Yeah just sit back and enjoy the show
i mean we wont know tn
dannys going w heeet death
Unsure if I want to experience disappointment with a group
ill probs head there at 
Yeah I was thinking itd be cool to hang
theyre like we have comforting drinks and seats to sit in
no bands or anything just literally the bottle lol
What if I made a twitch and streamed all night
no get this its just the bottle but theyre saying election night
What is the thing at the bottle If it involves watching results come in Im not interested
youre gonna elect Biden
Idk if you werent always nice to me in high school Ill doxx your ass sorry
Sorry I just doxxed her
Khive girl I went to high school with posting stuff like this
jk xD
Idk I cant really talk because I dont even have a podcast or anything
yeah its literally gross and once the election is over im gonna cancel her
She writes with such an authoritative voice while editorializing so much
also im probs gonna head to EB after dinner
They are having their moment in the sun
nooo but i gotta shit talk her bc reading her language makes me feel dystopian
Where are they at
Remember khive
Its ok to think bernie bros are annoying but Im not taking you seriously as a political analyst sorry
I used girl i guess in Chicago for city races if I didnt know who to vote for via other progressive endorsements
Nobody should feel bad for using girl I guess but in  she said it was perfectly valid to not vote for bernie because you didnt like the perception of bernie Bros which isnt an illegitimate opinion its just kind of a dumb thing to base an endorsement on rather than the candidates policy or record
And we just vote that person
There should be a position called informed voter
Who do I know whos great with water
This is what Im working on in the situation room
bureaucratic politics is kind of a symptom and cause of corruption in situations like this
that feels like an argument against democracy
frankly it seems dumb that I should be the one deciding who is on the metropolitan water board
Yeah its too much to know it all on your own
I dont feel bad about using Girl I Guess bc I have always voted based on what someone I know who seems progressive is saying
Adrienne does not seem to love it
Im calling our living room The situation room today
Yes Im libmaxxing watching CNN
I know Andrew Shankland with appreciate that one
Also Im watching CNN and the Georgia secretary of state just said about an alleged Russian voter intimidation hoax they messed with the wrong georgia
I actually met the lady I voted for in the school board race she rocks
Also I think they usually just do endorsements and not full on guides but they really only endorsed a few school board races this year Idk I just went with the CTU endorsementswhat mary told me for school board
cant remember exactly but Im pretty sure they did because theres nothing the DSA likes better than subdividing itself into too many random groups
They did end up doing this lol
I should get to vote five times for being around long enough to remember when the Chicago DSA wanted to split into a blue line chapter and a red line chapter bc all of the Logan square dsa people were like its actually really hard to go to lakeview
And I was like Kamala is girl boss sorry
I voted in McHenry county and the judge who gave me my ballot had a shirt that said we the people do not comply
Ive heard other people have this hypothesis and I think its a pretty valid thing to do lol
they didnt bc its not  anymore 
Rest of the test was pretty easy I didnt have to cheat
And as much as Im shitting on it I dont want people to feel guilty for using it in any capacity I just think for things like city council and school board races its very important to also check in with local orgs in your neighborhood to hear whats really going on Were lucky to live in a place where are there multiple voter research resources like this we should utilize all of them
But they didnt so I also used Girl I Guess for judges
I thought the Chicago DSA wouldve published a voter guide
I just heard once that judges almost never get booted
And is also not what i did
My very dumb take is that judges are so hard to boot out that you could almost just vote no on all of them and contribute to the bad judges who might be getting enough nos This is an idea i made up though and is dumb
Injustice watch goes pretty thorough on judges and is super helpful
And Im sitting here making fun of her but I still used used it
I used it for judge retention
As Bruce pointed out she didnt even bother writing any analysis whatsoever on the judges just yes or no lol
But even someone like her cant get too cute with races like that
I caved and used the guide for the judges and water dept shit
girl i fuckin guess bitch
But you were just being polite
Ya shed probably be rude if you were like oh i love your voter guide
she seems like shed be awful at a party
i reread it and want to keep shit talking her
did we all use girl i guess
Powerful post
But im basing that on how she doesnt look like either of the ladies in that meme
Lol i am sure she is not
Unless someone tells me Chelsea hood is Latina in which case I will volunteer for the democrats every day for a year
Just seemed like a weird thing for her to post
Wait this is reminding me
Your aunt is Gary Oldman
Aunt
Aint posting on her dead husbands fb
Yeah Im pretty antireality show but I would devour an Alec Baldwin reality show
I am more interested in his fake Latina wife whos birthed dozens of children and still has a perfect Pilates body
I mean I do kinda feel bad for him for the whole accidentally killing someone on a movie set thing cause it was that nepo baby non union person that fucked up and not him but then I remember that time he drunk dialed his daughters voicemail and called her a nasty little pig
Oh good
Are people aware he has an upcoming reality show
Especially Alec Baldwin
No Irish person has ever done anything wrong
Southside Irish are either cop loving fascists or like full on maoist militia members no inbetween
I wont stand for this slander against my people 
And I know from experience that everybody thats Italian and Irish on the south side are incredible at being judgmental
I think there was one Irish judge whos gay hes chill
South Side Chirish til I die
Hey man fuck you
If it says theyre from Beverly RUN
Irish too mostly especially Southside irish
Yeah you can just safely vote no on any Italian judge
from injustice watch
So hes not legally a child but he cant vote since he isnt a citizen 
All of these questions should be on the FAQ of the Frankie website
Does he have a fake ID that lists him as a child
Does frankie watch adult porn or
Jeff I dont think the question here is that hes not an adult But did he legally change his status to kid
hes not a kid comedian hes a kid comedian
Can a mod pls deal with this sick and tired of explaining
Frankie  Steve Kornacki
Wait Jeff you really should have done Frankies Election Covewage
Can Frankie vote or is he legally a kid
""
My friend has been posting about voting multiple times like hell post voted a th time felt great And some page messaged him and they were like hi were doing a study about people who do multiple votes can we use this as evidence
The first election had to redo because everyone voted for themselves
Much better choice than president bone
I wrote in pitterpaw the human cat
Yeah but some people commit a crime to vote twice in a place that wins by  votes
I mean same for voting in general
Idk why anyone would commit voter fraud you get no money and it barely does anything
Im voting at Stowe
Whats funny is the two party system basically started because Jefferson and adams hated each other
Unless its  and youre Eugene Debs lol
Yeah and that ultimately comes back the the country being designed with the two party system in mind You need to have Michael Bloomberg money to even try to be independent
Right but chicago city council is technically nonpartisan If any DSA people run in partisan races they usually have to run as democrats for the funding
I think the reason for this is just that down ballot races arent sexy and they dont have it in them to organize for it
Especially if it leads to absolute piece of shit Mike Braun losing
Based
DSA had a good run with the caucus of alderpeople in chi
Very excited to see that
The libertarian candidate for Governor might get  percent of the vote in Indiana
Working at a polling place no lines
Because libertarians actually do hold some seats here and there but theyre gross
I mean the green party not all third parties lol
If third parties were serious about gaining power theyd be running serious campaigns to win city councilstate reps seats across the country but they arent remotely interested in that which sucks
Jill stein is kind of an egomaniac and her vp is anti trans
Hoover
What a weird starting point
Kimothy Bednardki
Mine sent me this
Cant wait to see the things Kim will post over the next  hours
Mom just posted this on Instagram
Actually anybody who did wait to vote is kind of stupid
Just voted with zero wait
Yeah girl I guess has too much power this is wild to me
LOL
omg chet got put in the back of the line next to faux burns and theyre becoming friends
the guy we all thought was mo burns is here
Yeah u should just be able to vote on ur phone
It should all be done like American Idol voting
And we do need better schools And everybody should get a silver dollar
New York has ranked choice for primaries it was awesome
And better schools
We need ranked choice voting
Surely they would sweep the nation with our help
Imagine if there was a third party candidate that won the hearts and minds of this entire chat
Yeah see that is no good for me Sucks that third party is a joke and probably even more offensive of a vote in the eyes of our collective moms
And apparently he had some things to say about trans people
This is the argument every election and as someone that used to use it I think it is still a bit pie in the sky
Steins vp is named Butch
In  the libertarian vp picks name was Spike
And we are safe in our blue state not to effect electoral college margin But yeah I dont really actually know much about Jill Stein other than shes the one who supports a ceasefire
My friend has been posting vote Jill Stein stuff not because I think he loves Jill Stein but because if she gets  of the vote nationally then they will fund rd party campaigns differently and they can be more viable in the future
That being said I do think stein is kind of a crank now
Imagine if a whole town was stein voters
Game of margins in very specific places though and its not like there are a TON of stein voters in rural PA
Yeah in theory I have nothing against it
And if you completely remove the option of voting rd party it removes and way of dissenting from dnc hegemony
Idk I think the argument is legitimate its all a game of margins
I guess my take is that third parties usually represent such a small portion of the vote especially in swing states that it just kind of creates a punching bag for the dems to use if they lose Like I only know of two people that have ever cast a ballot for Stein and one of them is me lol
How tf has the green party survived for wo long
IDK Ive been hands off with this election
She is just literally not on the ballot in Illinois
But a friend shared a video of her VP going on the record as being kinda restrictive of abortions
IDK I know that sort of the lib Anti third candidate response
Wouldnt vote for Stein this year but I did in  and still feel ok about it
Just curious to hear your thoughts because I generally disagree with the rd party candidates siphon democrat votes but am open to other perspectivea
Speak on this Ian
Sorry excuse for a retaining wall
Pfh
If you havent worked on any down ballot seats in  years WTF are you actually doing
I would think a Russian asset would run a better campaign
AoC has a good take on her
I do think shes sorta being employed as a right wing siphon tho for Kamala votes
Im writing in Calvin Harris
My brain turns off anytime I see Russian asset as a phrase
Anyone hear this business about Jill Stein being a Russian asset
Why cant this man be our vice president
Hes just like me for real
Hey is there a single place to piss in the loop this is nuts
I saw it pop up
He recorded a video on his dads channel recently lol
I bet hes in Iowa
John Hickock is gonna love this
victoria based replacement
The video for that is great he says hes gonna give us giant beers
No part of Milwaukee looks that beautiful
hes at Coles bar
Or here in Chicago
Lol is he in Milwaukee
It took me  hours yesterday 
Coles hosts trying to encourage participation from the noncomedian crowd
If only he could have puffed loud in the line he could have kept his cool
Hes too young to handle the pressure of civic duty 
He like fully registered lol
kid waited in line to register for the first time and then just walked out saying i actually dont have time to vote
Palm is healing up nicely
Chat wakes up at am to vote but to work BUDDY you know chats not getting up before am
preparing to wait in line in the rain for hours like a soccer mom on the sidelines of American democracy bitch Cutting up orange slices for all the election booth ladies
Jesus Christ why are all you dorks awake
Libraries are the only place there are any social services anymore
At the library
Is this at a polling place too Where in the city proper are they anticipating that level of bleeding
hunny I need this for my period
I waited in line for an hour yesterday at Humboldt park and had to bail because I would have been late to work Apparently people were waiting so long that at like  last night they gave people in line pizza
Im a single issue voter and the issue is the Irish
Like they vote for who the REAL elected school board of Chicago is really gonna be
I bet celebrities have a raya app but for voting
Luke deleted lbum de Luke
more brick and mortal baggu
excited to vote for the measure that will allow another baggu store to open in Chicago 
i wonder who the dare voted for
For the elected school bart
I voted for Bart Simpson
I know you guys arent excited about Kamala but the elected school board is exciting so at least theres that
hunni thats just my opening set at crushes time clock
Time to vote downtown
Luke created lbum de Luke
coles regular is like less hate more pizza
i kinda was like well i kinda want to attack rn
wait what did everyone do for the law thats like if someone tries to attack at a voting poll they get fined
on injustice watch theres always an alert for judges with Irish names thats like  drunkenly drove car into Lake Michigan
I went at am at chase elementary took like  minutes the voting machine broke immediately lol All of the ballots are in a blue locker in thr schools art supply room its hard to know if thats government issued or some kindergartener is losing a cubby for the day
Sorry if Im too active in the chat Im anticipating being bored as hell
I have an all day pd instead of the day off 
no way they have good intentions in chicago
Big step
and then i stopped voting for irish names
Thats what Ali did for judges she just went democrat women She had more choices she could have used on the guys but she didnt trust it haha
i stopped listening to the girl i guess list and just voted for all the girls
Never works out
This group chat can have an outsized effect on getting a wheres my hug guy out of office
The players mentality we call it
I was already planning on voting against him because of his gay baby face
Lol lets goo
Someone your dad knows
hes my dads friend and always says i owe him a hug and hes creepy
hey this is random but dont vote for judge kenneth wright
ok i did it took an hour exactly
But shes also in multiple Pritzker ads
This girl I went to high school with is a die hard kamala supporter and she was like Im voting for her even though I disagree with her on many issues and then didnt enumerate any of then lol
And hes going to bomb Syria
Pete Buttigieg hanging in the back waiting to take his spot
God its suck if Tim Walz drops last minute
And sometimes people cancel Even after the poster is out
Lol
Thats literally how we book comedy shows
Like a verbal confirmation on Instagram with a stranger
I dont dislike the premise it just feels very easy to infiltrate
Especially for weird guys like me that want to make friends
Its an interesting idea tho
Feels like republican trickery
I saw this organization on insta that matches you with someone in a swing state that feels weird about voting for Kamala so you vote for their protest person in the blue state and they vote Kamala in their state
No exactly
If I hadnt sucked it up and voted for Biden in  maybe I would have done it But fool me twice shame on me
maybe they let me vote faster
If trump wins Illinois I will volunteer every weekend for the democrats for a year
Im gonna play podcasts off a beats pill the whole time Im in line
But I havent heard a compelling argument not to use a protest vote in a blue state
Dont tell my mom I said that
No Im fully waiting to not vote for Kamala
and I know what mine is telling me to do 
essentially what Im saying is vote with your heart 
The line is moving fast but its definitely getting longer I got here right when it opened at  and have been waiting an hour
NYC is also a blue stronghold tho
I left president blank Ill say it
not to be that guy
you like dont have to tho bc illinois and chicago will always be blue
It bums me out how much dems are playing the its the most important election of our life card again especially after spending the better part of a year trying to run Biden which should he considered elder abuse
Also same day voter registration which I did a lot lol
i know its past the point but god dammit this is so gay that i have to vote for kamala
Chicago sights are way too small and understaffed I think thats a part of it
In  I got back together with my ex on election day so its going to he hard to beat that
I might go to the super site downtown bc they have like 
they fucking want us to give up its so insane
five voting booths for an entire presenct
The place I got coffee from wouldnt give me a free coffee because I didnt have a sticker even though I voted early
Im going to pretend it took me four hours and take the morning off
It would rock to get fired for voting and file a wrongful termination suit Easy money
Sorry guys Ill chill
WE ARE NOT GOING BACK
Legally they cant do this btw
Imagine how exciting today would be if you were someone that loves Kamala tho Can we be happy for them
Im voting downtown fml and Im about to get in after an hour or so outside
yoooo i think im about to vote nvm an hour wait not too bad
so im just like kinda feeling like  really woooozy lol
i accidentally wore too warm of an outfit too
Yeah or a rock and roll themed monster dance
Its just the other option is so bad
yeah its not even like a fun ride
Its not even for someone good
Well its also crazy that you have to wait  hrs to vote for kamala
and they know im not libtard enough to stake out
they dont want us to vote
yeah dude its dystopian
damn I hate America so much 
will keep u updated on my wait im giving up at  am
i havent heard of anyone who hasnt waited yet
ugh dude im sorry its more likely than not
I have to go down to Bridgeport today and if I have to do that after waiting  hours in the rain Im going to kms
like im just lucky i dont work today but my job would fire me if i did t show up bc of voting
it literally is because who has the fucking time to vote besides old people then
It was never like this before
sorry but thats incredibly prohibitive to literally everyone and is essentially voter intimidation
am i crazy or was it never like this before
no literally
I feel like we should all be entitled to a class action lawsuit for having to wait more than one hour to vote
im a bad american but im leaving after hour 
yeah in lowkey like how did anyone wait  hours
Ive always voted at this library
im also like confused if im voting in twenty minutes or voting in two hours bc the line wraps around a hall
not to be like a bitch but I have a really bad cold rn and I think itll put me in the ground if I have to wait in the rain
look yours up now if ya dont know it bc its confusing
but also it took me like a second to figure out which presenct im in
fuck
seems promising
Im abt to head out to Logan square library hoping theres not a crazy line
im  min in
goethe
which polling place are you at
im in line rn hoping it isnt the same wait as everyone else lmao
anyone try to vote at like  am
It was the universal monsters rock n roll show hosted by Japanese Beatlejuice
Japanese Beetlejuice is one of the greatest performers of our lifetime
All I know is
If I knew what the hell was going on id tell ya
Who are those two guys
I have mostly good things to say about Japanese beetlejuice at the moment
Say what you will about Japanese Beetlejuice but his crowd work is as sharp as ever
Because of Palestine right
so cool
Well just a handshake
Woah invited to the couch to chat
Maddie weiner about to do standup on Jimmy Fallon in like  minutes
How da hell does he come up with such outlandish scenarios
I was waiting for his endorsement but it took too long
Wish I wouldve known this before I voted
Shit hes gonna undo the hinchcliff stuff
Never meet your heroes 
that actually helps a lot to confuse me more thank you
Will you be more confused when I say that The Rock voices Maui
watching moana and really confused is maui based on jason momoa or is jason momoa based on maui
What a turn thatd be
Haha what if he does
We just elected this guy
Its Nov  in Japan the election is happening
But there is no set of circumstances where Trump concedes
If its decisive enough yeah
We might know who wins the general before we know every state
Yeah I mean best case scenario is two months of lawsuits and bullshit
Also I dont think well know who won tomorrow Itll drag out just like  I bet
DNC is still doing  matches for donations
I knew I should have spent more money on TV ads
God dammit Adrienne
i voted for tony to continue getting texts
Such a banger
Theyre all for the God damn school board too Fuck your charter school money I already voted for the single mother candidate Eat my ass
Dont get complacent
Midterms will be here sooner than you think
Bro I am still getting political texts I was told this would stop when I voted I need this shit to be over
If anyone besides Ian likes anime going to this seat m
Mumble into the wind and hell be there
how do I contact Joe Swanberg
Me too
Im a sicko and actually like the vibes of voting in person
I listen to that one a couple of times a year
Now I can do my report cards
Ive been voting by mail since like  and cannot fathom voting in person I voted literally at the end of September
Lines are way shorter on the actual day of because theres like  more voting locations
I early voted this year but normally I vote Election Day
Ive been doing it ever since
It rolled over from  by default
Why arent all of you already doing mail in voting
Ty sm
It was Dan Pfiffers
It wasnt Jon Lovetts
I have to apologize
i ruined a friendship for sending him a naked taz
Mitchell Potts which chapo episode do they dunk on Jon Lovetts book Im trying to find it
At least we dont have to do a caucus like those pig fuckers in Iowa
I swear to God Im doing mail in voting next year
She might actually make me lose faith in the democratic process 
this might count as voter intimidation
Thats fair
I would but then i would have to spend more time with her
I dont know what shes doing is illegal but it should be
You should perform a citizens arrest
Wake up
you should start doing system of a down
She is telling every man youd be prettier if you smiled more and idk if shes subverting the trope or what Everyone she says it to hates it
One of the songs was Hazy Shade of Winter
Its like a marathon of annoying things shes doibg
Shes also making a gap in the line saying im not from chicago i know yall like to be all up on each other but i LIKE MY PERSONAL SPACE
Songs youve heard or does it sound like shes just got the music inside of her
Im an hour into waiting in line to vote and the woman im behind has been singing loudly the whole time and telling every person that walks past us they should smile more
Ill send to you
Who cares

Send to chat

Where are you going
On the Amtrak with my friend Sue
Family guy karaoke bar
Got ice cream at Osaka Castle
Yeah hey lets talk about something else yall
 
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer added Brook Whitehead to the group
Oh he was
Had no idea he was a prize fighter in Poland not sure if you were joking about that but I  believe it
Whereas I look an even more feeble and flabby michael cera
Hes like  and built like a brick shithouse
Yeah that factored into it
He wouldve punched you in the face if you said he couldnt go up
I mean it was like him and  other slobbering drunk old heads and like a handful of other comics in the whole room Feeling guilt pangs about it rn
I could have stopped it
That must have been like the one week I stayed home sick
That was literally the moment I was like I do not want to host an open mic anymore lol
He came to lotties one night with a bunch of other old heads all of them piss drunk and went way WAY over time I knew about his bad reputation but it was like  am and we just let him go up anyway Feel shitty about it still
But yeah definitely a piece of shit
He is an enormous man
lmfao what
Was a championship boxer in poland and is a terrifying person
He works at cleos now i think earlier this year he punched blake burkhart in the face
I guess it goes without saying that it pisses me off
Pisses me off
But anyone that books him sucks too
Its like enough people that knew about it moved
Weirdly some people started booking him again in the last year or so
He was my favorite comic when i was young here but nope definitely a piece of shit and definitely a rapist
What a shame this is reallllllly good 
He is a rapist
Junior was like the only Chicago comedian on one of those Vulture comedians you will know things He was pretty big relative to the scene and then got cancelled for a reason I dont know
""
Hes like an edgelord that wears pigtails
I also dont know who Junior is
My dads response to meeting Pete B
Thats the only explanation that doesnt involve him having a mental breakdown
I genuinely think he had to have lost a bet
Can anyone in this chat fill me in  on junior stopka Who is this guy and why is John hickok obsessed with him
"Trying not to do bits or isolate 

This is growth "

"I got dumped in a pretty rough abrupt way

I could use distractions Please invite me to stuff I might just be quiet in the corner but I think it would help me heal to be around folks"
Idk what is going on
Ive have never had to wait even  mins in the past
No but the ballots are a lot shorter here
People arent reading the Damm girl I guess voters guide in there
But I have a theory why
I never did it in Illinois it was so convenient took  min
Yeah idk what it is but early voting is way easier in nyc
Its very quick here why is it so fucked in Chicago
Oh my god really
Almost to the front
I have been in line to vote since about pm
Roemember Roemember the fifth of November
Shes a huge lib and a huge Brian Roe fan
who will clean ur toilets mr trump
She followed me first 
Oh are you following my mom on ig too
Thinking about going to see Anora tomorrow night if anybody wants to join
and my review will be it DOESNT stink
I dont read books by men unless Jon Lovitz finally decides to take up the pen
No
I heard a story about someone seeing Job Lovitz in public and being like youre Jon Lovitz And him just responding Jealous
Did you mean Jon Lovitz
Damn chat was epic this morning
Going to hit the food court

Would love to drive with some buds
Going to comedy on state Wednesday for da mic
Mary wants to take a vacation to Potomac Maryland cause of that show

I am an active voter at wwhltv
RidinWithBiden BidenStrong JeSuiBiden
I like this idea
Sorry Im already writing in Biden
No worries if not
Would be sick to come in like st
Anyone want to write my name in for president
""
The Selzer poll and the Andy Cohen Whats What Happen Live push poll has me feeling pretty good about things
Also probably gonna go to empty bottle on election night should be a good hang
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer set the nickname for Andrew Shankland to unregistered marxist
Something entertaining to look at during this two hour wait
Also there is a volleyball tournament at my voting place
He wrote a song about him called mean old Mr trump or something
Trumps dad was also woody Guthries landlord lol
I voted for Kristin Gillebrand which was tough bc I hate blondes
Also if were voting based on dads Trumps was a literal klan member
Tbf he is a Marxist but she also think that means facist
And I was like oh shit I forgot to reup my membership
Someone at work said her dad was a registered marxist
I know Kamala is not progressive enough for most of the chat but if it makes you feel better according to my parents we are all voting for a communist sleeper cell 
Vote for Kamala so Tony Hinchcliffe will have a little footnote in future social studies books
Literally doing the oh you guys dont like that one shit at fucking Madison Square garden
Comedy is so powerful
That kill Tony clip was so fucking insane He was treating it like an open mic That guy is such a shitty comic and person its unbelievable that he really might change the course of American history lol
No he is I eas just being cheeky
Shank is a fake fan
No hes still doing it
I mean james Austin Johnson has the trump impression spot on there now right Or is he not on the cast anymore
And Ive gotta see that
Ann Selzers poll has Harris   in Iowa which could mean an ultimate humiliation for TrumpMusk Kill Tony
In a way its like were voting for if we want Alec Baldwin or Maya Rudolph to guest more on snl
Single issue voter here
Also Elon needs to be humiliated Im sorry
Im writing in Hilary again give her a chance
Reading girl I guess and shaking my head so everyone knows I did independent research
And there are actually some good judges on there that are worth retaining Like theres one on here that ruled in favor of a tenants union in a housing case We gotta keep her
And now its like fuck now  we have to vote
Civil crime
Like people who jump turnstiles
I feel like its because we all thought Kamala was a guarantee
Yeah i think a lot about how it ultimately affects sentencing for petty crimes
Theres only so many hours in a day to listen to podcasts and video essays
I feel like judges is maybe our most impactful vote bc so many people probably skip that
You can narrow it down based on your ballot but its still a lot to read lol
And thats coming from me
Its really useful tbh
Thats fine imo theres so many fucking judges you gotta have a life at some point
j feel like a month ago everyone was like im not voting
Injustice watch has a far more detailed judge guide
Sometimes Ill read it and be like lol thats dumb as hell and then vote for someone she doesnt like because they represent my values better
This year for judges she just said Im not elaborating heres the yesno list
I just have a personal grudge against Stephanie skora and thats my problem
Reading girl I guess and forming an opinion based on what she says is research
Nah youre good its a fine guide at the end of the day
but dont say ur a political comic
I know its probably bad to rely so much on one persons opinion but in what world am I gonna independently research hundreds of candidates
cum is political
Heck I even read some of it
everything i do is political
no thats what im sayin
I used it in Chicago
Also Im gonna vote today am I not allowed to use the girl I guess guide
There are a lot of funny people that do good political humor but anyone that labels their comedy as political is sus
Apparently my aunt was going to marry an Italian guy and my Irish great grandmother kept saying shell never be happy
what do u mean u want to write for the daley show
political comics are random to me
And Ive been waiting to get that stuff about Julia Claire off my chest
Nobody else does lol
Never apologize for spamming the chat
Sorry for spamming the chat today but Im still in line to vote and bored out of my mind reading these judge guides and this made me literally laugh out loud
Right wing political commentator lookin ass boi
Mary put me in a snapchat filter that makes you look like a politician and I look like Matt walsh
And they have worked on major campaigns so some of their insight is worth listening to but I kinda cant stand them
That exactly how I feel about it
Pod save is good if you wanna know what the middle of the road dems are thinking about shit
Like they print money off orange man bad
Like dont they kind of stand to gain if Trump wins
One of the best episodes of Chapo is when they made fun of Jon Lovetts book
I guess Roald Dahl was a big racist though
I hate the Pod Save shit
Too good for James and the giant peach then eh
Famed feminist thinker Jon Lovett
Lmaooooooo
I went on a date once with this girl who was like a DNC diehard and she told me she never reads books by men except she made an exception for Jon lovett
But I like Kate a lot I think shes great
And working w crooked media only underlines that to me like at that point just work for the dnc
Or like she always struck me as someone who was just more of a grifter
Didnt know they broke up
Her dads a cop and a lot of her takes were way soft imo
Kate Willet is really nice
Lol
She used to be kind of a leftist but now she works for crooked media after having a pod w Kate Willet who I like her
Shes pretty and tall and posts about politics thats all I really know about her
I just dont like her lol
Whats her deal is there tea
Yeah lol
The new york comic
Does anyone care about Julia Claire at all
The one I do did with a lot is th Ward Neighbors For Justice which my gf founded  Im so proud of her and love her so much
im just gonna text the guy who was the president of the socialist club at depaul and ask him who do i vote for
IPOs usually have names like th Ward Working Familesthats the Logan one I believe
DSA as well
CTU also has endorsements
I would recommend looking up if you guys have any independent political organizations IPOs in your wardneighborhood and see who they endorse
yeah i def wanna hear
its also funny bc the obvious answer is i should do my own research
If anyone wants to hear more about this give me three beers and I will give you a very detailed account
Im also just a little bitter about how she endorsed the other candidate in a race I volunteered on lol
its also like fucked up that shes just like i dont like this guy
""
Yeah its a little insane that the most popular progressive voter guide in Americas third largest city is a Google doc written by one or two people
Im a little fuzzy on the details
She was the head of Brave Space Alliance and when they tried forming a union some shady she went down while she was in charge
Sorry working families or whatever
Like her Endorsements often boil down to vote green or family labor
I mean lost of orgs do Endorsements and tbh if you know the parties it can be enough
im sure theres like gotta be another resource right
I thought it was two people She names another person in the intro
hmmmm
It used to be two or three people but now its just her
i feel like the girl i guess should be like a whole team of people thats insane
She really brings her own personal grievances into her Endorsements and will be like just vote this way bc I dont like the other person
Speak on this I havent heard but Im curious
She is Jewish to be fair
And also its like why is one white lady allowed to tell every neighborhood how to vote
I heard the girl I guess lady is a union buster
New york aint doing it like this
"yeah actually i think the criticism 
is that its fine but you should do more research"
I think there are a lot of valid criticisms you can make of her but I do not believe she is cancelled
did i make that up
isnt girl i guess cancelled
And we have more rats 
Took me  min almost all the judges were unopposed dems
Yeah we do things a little bigger here
The ballot in NYC is so small compared to Chicago
But theres so many it took like half an hour to fill in all those damn bubbles
I just followed girl I guess and I feel like it was like  yesno
I do enjoy reading injustice watchs stuff though these judges are so petty and corrupt
Sometimes ill check to see if there are any thst are definite yes but most are bad
I think thats mostly fine
Do you guys just vote no on every judge I aint reading all that
Im in line to early vote quickly googling what is kamala harris whole deal
Idk what she did but richies version woulve been the move
I looked it up she didnt call him that
wait is this real
Kamala just called Trump the f word on snl

A guy panhandling outside walgreens just now said wake up And i laughed and went grab your brush and put on a little make up and he looked at me really confused and turns out he was just making a joke that i looked sleepy Not everyone is trying to do system of a down songs with you
my gf bought a car with her cop lawsuit money lol
I hate cops
One for  and one for 
I got slapped with two tickets in two days

In many ways I agree
This is really Kristi coded
"Kristi is here come over yall 

 N Spaulding Ave"
Could not remember if it was you or mcshane that told me that hahahaha
This someone was me and it was a hilarious tension tables of models and people who should not be allowed to see them in real life
I just saw Lori lightfoot
Dude New Norm fell off
ugh finally
Happy birthday Kristi
It was unbelievable Kristis beautiful birthday was incredible Everyone celebrated in their own way I celebrated by being in japan
And yes theres a new episode 
For your wall Richie Owens
""
Im in too deep
Mom needs to send a pic or it didnt happen
literally blaming me for the water breaking
SUCH moments speak omg
you decided to be born
Also lucia I dont think you should do anything youre uncomfortable doing but k is k and if you did a propalestine set and donated a bunch of money thats something you can be proud of
I get all my political updates from the kill Tony subreddit
Im still not over his influence on our nation
""
Finally a crowd that will appreciate your bit about the pornhub app
Dont even get me started on president bone
They will LOVE my jokes about porn
Gimme your spot
Lucia
You gotta get me in that room
Oh man thatd be amazing lmao
you couldve given me a million guesses and I wouldve never guessed that Tony Hinchcliffe would be the October surprise
Damm comedy really can change the world
top subscribers sends a chill down my spine
and see if they post the clip hahah
Im gonna do a pro palestine set and donate  to palestine
Someone told me there were models and then a lot of old guys in suits at the taping they went to
So there could be a sinister horny energy in that room
If this makes any difference to you  I heard during the taping they invited top models AND top subscribers to watch the taping
I deleted that  because I forgot a very important negative in there
I think Im gonnna do a pro palestine set
Im going to unequivocally say that you should take the money
hahaha
Making k and supporting Israel  sounds like a win win no
yeah idk I think its also worth trusting your gut and like probably the only reason they give so much money is bc they know people dont want to be associated with them And like I think if youre not like hurting for money its worth evaluating the nonmonetary things youd gain from this Like of course an extra k is nice but what else would you be getting from doing something you might feel like youre compromising yourself ethically
"Yeah I think if youre not doing anything to directly beneficial for IsraelAIPAC by doing this taping youre morally in the clear 

Just by participating in the American economy  were all participating in something that benefits morally dubious people

That being said  if it makes you feel guilt if might not be worth doing"
Also Tyler horvarh only got like k or something
but i also think you can trust your gut and ive always found it weird that my friends are doing onlyfans like this
I will say that I subscribe to multiple onlyfans accounts and its truly the no ethical consumption thing I dont think just being a contributor like that is helping or hurting that guy any more than like every other evil person we give our money to or make money off of
Theyre throwing money in a very strange place considering what theyre known for
Get yo money
Unless you expect to earn them k in return
I dont think you should take my advice  but I think taking money away from the bad people can be good
but when I met with them i had a weird feeling in my gut partly dont want to be associated with only fans but also I just googled only fans israel ties and the owner has donated at least  million to AIPAC throughout the genocide
I was offered to do that onlyfans taping and it pays sort of an absurd amount  at least k upwards of k if you post a certain amount
hey guys i need some group conscience
danny surprised me w le bouchon nvm
Lots of good thrift stores in edgewater Patio Beef is good for a quick dogburger Ginos North best Tavern style pizza in the city
Happy birthday Kristi

Ian Erickson how was Kristis birthday in Japan
Oh i didnt know that but yeah looks like you can
you can take the lake bike path trail there though right
My favorite thing to explore in chicago is steelworkers park and the surrounding area its this whole abandoned area  that used to be a steel mill and looks post apocalyptic Bit of a drive though
Ive heard rly good things abt broadway antique market in edgewater if you wanna go lake vibes with some light shopping
no somewhere that requires traveling more than  min
Nobody knows whats up there
Hermosa
Happy birthday Kristi

But dont worry guys I wont lose heart 
Yeah I sent the clip as a courtesy He has seen me plenty of times I didnt imagine he would bother watching it
i lose heart every time i see chris trani and he introduces himself to me have known him for  years
AND never forget that I found him trying to climb Johns fence to get out instead of pushing the button to unlock the door and then scooter off in the wrong direction
But dont lose heart Megan
Also its so easy to find  minutes to watch a clip and hes probably seen you perform a bunch lmao
Dont lose heart is kinda like I know that this is probably really affecting your life

Do you want to hear how
Not under my watch
I figured out that you can actually
Think of your family
You cant be buried in Jewish cemetery

Paula Skaggs once went to a hotel in Japan and was like wow this is small and was in it for hours before she realized one of the walls was actually a sliding door into the actual bigger room
The s rip
But yes we do love the Halloween tree
Room is a lil smaller than we thought
Quick what do Americans like
And they fit that whole tree into an hotel room the size of a drawer
They do things a little different over here
Seems strong Ill probably go soon but many have just arrived
Whats the word on the crooners at KerryIke

Be so for real are you guys at kerryoke yet
For Kerryoke not jack white
If someone brings plates and forks I can bring some pastries from work
sooo gay that phlyzzz isnt opening for jack white
Happy birthday kerry
Guys are always selling this on the street in nyc I gotta get one
when I was a kid there were a bunch of rooms in my dads house he didnt put any furniture in bc he was like Im just one guy I cant go in that many rooms and we had this one room that was completely empty save for this big poster of the rat pack So that is kind of what crooner means to me
kerry can u define crooner
its a way of life
crooning is not a costume
Ive got the perfect shirt but its not a costume so Ill be dressed as Kerrys friend with an appropriate shirt
crooner attire encouraged whatever that means to you
diverting my party to Ryans show
Is Kerryoke a costumed affair
I wish I could go tho
Im starting to get a little sick from rebeccas sickness so Im probably not gonna make it to Kerrys unfortunately
I will support from here
I support you going and reporting back
I want to support my friend Ryan Oliver but I dont want to support the laugh factory by buying a ticket   drinks
I want to hear about it but I simply cannot put myself through that experience
Not being mean but I cannot imagine what the vibe in that room will be
Definitely the better way to spend tonight
sorry that was MEAN im going to kerrys bday
no
Is anyone going to go to Ryan Olivers hour tonight
Happy Birthday Kerry
Yes happy birthday Kerry
And to Kerry Allow me the first to say happy birthday
Yeah i dont think thatll rub anyone the wrong way worst case they already have it booked
Ok im going for it
Because then they dont even have to think about your availability
I think clubs even like if you ask for a particular person to work with
theyll probably just ignore you if it doesnt line up right
Zanies

Yall are idiots Thats a classic Chicago way to make sure vampires dont steal your garbage
Im not gonna put them in the can someone out there might need some faith
Someone is having a really bad day
Ugh were gonna have to be like in this climate its so important to laugh
Thats what I call the complete unraveling of society a little shake up
Honestly Ive been a little bored post covid I could use a little shake up
Like it couuuld destroy American democracy forever but my main concern is that it sounds like an annoying time period to live through
I fear trump losing and contesting the election might really damage the vibe
If trump wins the democrats are gonna roll over and take it like the good little subs they are
Oh great theyre gonna make us shelter in place for the democrat civil war 
The context was she think this is why the department of Ed is making us set up Google classrooms for remote work
God I hope that happens
A woman I work with said that if Trump wins the election the democrats wont certify it and it will cause a civil war
Yeah Im like how did I become his Momager
Brian Johnson is bound for great things
Its called delegating

And then asked me to log into his YouTube account to upload the video for him
Brian Johnson had me record his set at a mic
i feel bad still but yeah i guess its ok
ok phew
He only seems to do shows at butch mcguires
If it makes you feel better theres zero chance youll ever run into him

Kid at work just put gangnam style on the Bluetooth and was like have you heard of this song
Tonys truth emboldened him

Omg Kerry gets added to the REAL chat in tminus  hours
Maybe Ill just use a driveway sealant next year or something
but painting it would be easier
Im debating applying concrete on it directly and just smoothing it out
you guys think Ill get in trouble with the city if I paint the asphalt in the alley behind my house I want to smooth out the surface a little bit just so I can skateboard on it
You think turning one year older entitles you to plow through the riches of an empty movie theater
Its ok Sam I understand
You can ask ANYTHING you want 
a lot of possibility in this space
Enjoy greatness
treating myself to an entirely empty screening of megalopolis for an early birthday gift to myself

He went right wing right after everyone called his shit out
Menace

You have a better pulse on the Indiana boys tho idk
Corey was shitty to him but not at the level basil was
I think basil
Or however you spell it
Probably Corey Coruchiee
Ya who was he talking about

I love him dearly but I have a list  of comics who did me dirty too
He good boy I would be mad too tho if I were u
Zach Boyce is a really nice dude tho afaik

I think the maga base really feels like this is the last chance to save the country so theyre out in full support
The culture war is over and the right has won
It really goes to show how fucking stupid most people watching standup are that they buy Tonys bullshit wholesale I got a post from the kill Tony subreddit shown to me and the were all like hello its called comedy

I cant remember the details now bc it was during aoc so a little hectic
I can now admit that he told me he replaced the sword
Just like that broad city episode where they keep referencing broad city episodes
Sorry im always relating every situation to a broad city episode
This is just like on broad city when abby pegged the guy and put the dildo in the dishwasher and ruined it and tried to to get a new dildo but didnt know the guy had very specific taste in dildos
I figured like maybe he broke it and tried to replace it on the low And just like was afraid to tell me Or just mixed it up
And like he didnt even acknowledge that there could be a difference when I said anything
Im just as confused
Lmao I have no idea
Whats he up to 
For sure
Like this is just objectively a different and newer sword lol
I let judd crud borrow it and Im like  sure he gave me back a different knights of Columbus sword
Yah

Meat is so clutch when it comes to some restaurants
Im thinking about eating meat again so that I can understand restaurants better
"Also I liked the vibe Just a bunch of old Korean rock vinyls and the style was p tasteful 

I feel like theres always a chance a place like this could be done in a way where it just feels like theyre ripping like a fastfashion sense of style from Tik Tok and it feels like cheap or that its gonna be outdated in like  years"
But i felt like everything we had was really really good and decently priced for the quality
I feel like it has the potential to be one of those places that pops off on tik Tok and then maybe isnt as good down the line
Honestly I really liked it
oooh Ive been curious abt it since they changed things up but havent talked to anyone whos been there yet
Also we went to parachute hi fi for dinner Definitely recommend

To do that

Dude I hate my job but this creamer makes such incredible iced coffee
wait idk if I told anyone but my old boss at the documentary job is basically making no money from documentaries and I guess his scheme to get out of this mess is that he wants to open a sauna in Hyde Park bc theres a lot of politicians down there and maybe like through that gain access or clout or blackmail from them idk which is like the funniest and probably least efficient way of making money
No wires in da foreskin
Just a little insider knowledge
Theres a cold plunge in there so everyones wieners get small af
damn wish I was a dude so I could hold business meetings in a sauna to make sure no ones wearing a wire  maybe in the next life

The world has jaded my gentle soul

Open mics have the power to change the world

MThey Genderman
Texted you
Does anyone have sages number Trying to let her know I cant drop off the grimace costume

I just zipped past all the traffic going to the thrift store next to lincoln lodge
My lil ebike moped deal is so FUCKING sick
I would have if Caroline Twyman didnt FUCKING SABOTAGE ME
Youd think so but at my first customer service job Elizabeth Warren did kill a guy because he forgot to cancel a persons subscription
he lives in Washington state I dont even get the connection
obviously sharing because of the inexplicable Liz Warren reference
IDK just doesnt really hold water
Calling someone a chicken shit and then your big threat involves Liz warren
She works for him
That guy is Liz warrens boss
Oh thats right
Wait whats the part about Liz warren
Mike May just be getting his next box of Tiege Hanley

Have you ever drunken the diarrhea stuff they make you consume the night before the procedure
my shit will reach across the aisle
Who says politicians cant reach across the aisle
And guess what Ultimately we all eat and shit the same food into the same places
"Wokeman deipede

definitely something there"
Ill admit that I wrote that like weeks ago when I watched human centipede for the first time
I feel like its time for a HUMANE centipede
Now Im just in free flow idea state but what if the middle centipede gets a Michelin star
someones dad made that
bc its like she DOES exist
i love nepo baby human centipede
I waited in line for the midnight release
what if the front and back of the centipede are candidates for president and the middle is an undecided voter
You want to make a name for yourself on your own and create the human millipede
And you guys do human centipede twoprov
Or instead of a fade to black Beckett does a runcut in front of you improv style but hes a human centipede too
And then you and the other two centipedes exchange glances and laugh black out
IDK I just feel like between these two candidates either way Im gonna be eating shit
Topical
One of the centipede is a Republican one is a Democrat and youre an undecided voter
Like super sweet sixteen but your an inhuman monster
And youre like a spoiled rich girl who doesnt like this human centipede because it only has three segments
But they want to stay in the centipede
i feel like i need more of a take on it
Human centipede polycule but one of the people in the centipede either isnt in the polycule or wants out
Your dad could be giving it to you as a birthday gift
like so what i make out w my dad then and then we just say and scene
i just think its like ok i make a human centipede but then where do we go from here
They finally invented shy porn bots
Maybe come back when you have some clout leonard
Meggie Gates was human centipede for halloween one year You can ask them how they did it
I actually had the idea to do that before the movie
Human centipede would be legendary Kristi
I think that might be easier to set up than a human centipede production but it seems like that a lot of your ideas are bending towards HC so if you can find a way to get that in the mix you gotta go for it
And you could have Becket play any number of characters
And then you can act out whats going on inside your colon
You could put like a hose in your or someone elses mouth and say thats a camera
Nice try my kid is named Aspergers
What did it give him
It gave your kid Autism what
theyre kinda gay but its def a fun show and a very easy space to go gross intense
Dude it gave my kid autism not worth it
its that show yuck thats like  yeah were fucked up and gross but pls wear a mask
Can u give more context on colonoscopy show
Oh is the new booster out
or i could just do stand up
or admit that my dad made human centipede and im a nepo baby and beckett plays my dad and he makes me do one last human centipede and then me and beckett fuck on stage
kind of like unedited footage of a bear vibe
should i do a pepto bismo commercial where i drink an entire jug of pepto and shit physical bricks
snd i wanna do a human centipede bit so bad but i fear thats a whole production
and i have too many ideas
im doing a colonoscopy show on saturday
i need help w a bit
Just one full daynight
Fucked me up for a day too

New Covid booster is giving me such a bad headache

But he did give him a car
Gran Torino is one of the funniest movies in the world because he just wrote a movie where he says a bunch of slurs and is still racist at the end
Watched Gran Torino in a high school class called Minority Studies taught by a white guy
I havent seen it but its the only one that Im interested in
I know thats a silly question
Is it genuinely a fun watch
The only Clint Eastwood movie Im interested in is The Mule where he plays a drug mule and has a threesome and it came out when he was  years old
Clint Eastwood plays the funniest gruff asshoke with a heart of gold every single film hes in
I liked it
Watched million dollar baby for the first time
Vegan gas

Been wanting a reason to force this pic into the chat
""
I went to a fast and furious filming location in malibu
Hes done everything in his power to seem italian
lmao I didnt even think about that
That is very fair
You thought a man whose most famous character is named Dominick Toretto was Italian
That is an italian man
I was confident
Like until this year
Have I told this chat that I thought Vin Diesel was italian
Its so sick to double down on him in a city full of famous Italians
Not to sound like a massive shill but saying you introduced the wheel to anyone is kind of absurd
This is so funny coming from a museum
I discover da America 
Also mentioned how he never owned slaves and adopted an indigenous child and its likehe just got a slave
I was outside of the Italian American museum closed smh and they had a sign with facts about Columbus and one was introduced wheel to western hemisphere and the last was arrived in word of human sacrifice cannibalism and slavery

One of the moms in my neighborhood is looking to bust this sex shop near my apartment
Anything but that 
Yeah Id hate to go blessed mode
But I like the idea of him going rogue and really speaking truth to power on the show
Kenan will always have work
every time he thinks about quitting he thinks about where Kel has ended up
he clearly knows his career has nowhere to go but down post SNL
I wouldnt ask any questions if I were Kenan Thompson
I once saw him walking around drunk on the ice at  Rock just hitting anybody that tried to get near him
Let him say the stuff theyre too scared to say
I wish they would finally get out of kennans way
""
AI rather have a beer than watch that
Snl AI
I assume its because they have to appeal to so many people but it really feels so one dimensional like its trying to optimize for search results
oh uhm
yeah i always get sad seeing keenan thompson get held back by that show
when they make the squirm do normal comedy im like ok let her rip
and they think they need to address it
and i dont like watching the funniest person in my eyes do like a lame sketch it makes me sad
stuff just builds up
I feel like its gotta all be because of the summer break
the bachelor espresso sketch was so odd
snl does feel ai 
Ill never figure it out 
Theres a difference between joking on and joking about
Oh yeah for sure
Yeah id say just dont punch down
But it is interesting lots of wild stuff
Id have to say I work in traditional apartments I guess
Everyone wants me to write jokes about it lol but I feel weird writing jokes about the people who live in section 
Is it helping your art
This place youre working at sounds so incredible
Hahahahahahahaha
They made this last week while it was still PEAK brat summer
I talked to the husband then the wife tried to talk to me and then the husband again but this time with the wife just screaming In the background
And these people are freaking out
The housing complex I work for is doing renovations
What did I miss
Renovation company
I just spent  minutes on a call explaining to people that the renovation company was not doing voodoo on me and let me just say they never believed me
""
No give an example
Has anyone been watching snl at all Some of these sketches feel ai generated
Im good for awhile
Full freezer from da aldis shutting down by my work
Damn did u hear salt shed got rabies now
Weird Al style
Jeff tell Frankie to cover one of their songs
Looks like they also edited the original caption so Jeff is featured more prominently
I mean the Frankie connections were just right there
The fact they make stuff for emo kids tho
Oh damn we put all of our honesty and truth into music so we cant really bring that into other aspects
Integrity isnt like a finite source like
Well also do to something where you just steal a comedy video premise and beats word for word for the sake of your Instagram band page I cant imagine they have too much integrity in their other endeavors
Just listened to the band and it makes sense they steal content the original stuff they make is bad
lol
The important thing is I achieved an arbitrary moral victory that I set for myself  And I am now in the good graces of the next big emo pop band
Like its ok that we stole this because we admitted it
If they happened to come up with a similar concept thats one thing but tagging you and using the same lines is crazy
Only loose end to tie up is making sure theyre embarrassed
I said they didnt have to so long as they made the credit more prominent because from talking with them I dont think they had malice and I also feel like the premise itself is somewhat low hanging so I dont feel that much ownership to begin with If I were them I would be embarrassed to have it up but they can do as they please
idk if Im dumb for thinking that because theyre musicians they dont know you cant do covers for comedy
So these guys got the dm and didnt take the video down
Lets all dress up like Frankie but with guy Fawkes masks
Lets do dumb viral death grips shit in their pit
i hate them
that makes sense bc theyre bottoms
Lets picket
Theyre playing bottom lounge november 
Yeah the really annoying part of this is you also cannot discredit the idea that they are just super fucking dumb and didnt realize what they did was wrong or bad
Jeff Braun now theyre cribbing inspo from your favorite movie
truthfully id be more mad that theyre gay as fuck
Im going to keep being mean until something else happens
Dear lord
thats enough from the bullshit pop punk factory for the day
Nah Im going deep now
Im going to bed see you guys tomorrow
Hell Im calling it a day now
as long as someone today learned a lesson i can sleep tonight
They responded to DM kindly as well I think they meant no harm and are just hacks which is fine They learned a lesson which is more important
I would be mad Jeff Braun
It is kind of wild
Their parents must be very rich to afford doctors who could figure out a claim of neurodivergence here
I hope they feel piled on to
Had to add on to your comment ian
That perfectly solves everything
They pinned a comment crediting me Gotta chalk that up as a victory imo
Next theyre be stealing retribution
Would be so funny if they started doing Frankie stuff next
As of now Ive gotten  follows
I did dm them turns out I had to follow
jeff let us know how many follows u get from this clip
I know were in the middle of hating just wanted to say
The new Zelda is really really good
Theyre kind of famous for being unique and original
soooooo embarrassing
god i hate pop punk emo people
Some people never grow out of the repeating something funny they heard phase
Its just bc of the joke in the caption
Like Jeff at least put on scrubs and pretended to be a doctor
Also like what is even the context that theyre doing this bit
they look gay
yeah also theyre gay
Really Im having a hard time
God I can tell these guys suck so much
""
Reporting them for hate speech
Unleash the army
Wait I cant  them because they dont follow me lol fuck them
Theres not a single clip of their music its all engagement farming bullshit
Maybe they were on a social media post deadline and just needed to submit something and they misremembered and thought they came up with this idea
We dont really know what theyre going thru where they felt like the need to do this
Eh fuck it Im gonna DM em
They seem like really good guys
Fwankie sent me hewe and is  fweatening viowence
Im teetering on just DMing them I feel strong in my principles but kinda doubt anything of consequence will happen either way in which case maybe not worth the like emotional expenditure
hey this is just a Jeff Braun video
The musicians that do shit like this are always big fucking hacks
Jeff do want us to comment on your behalf
Summon the frankiebots
Get the Frankie army on them
u know what i hate them
yeah bc how many people are even looking at the caption that says this is jeffs idea
I dont think I would have enjoyed it but I wouldnt have any like moral qualms with it since it would be obvious they were referencing something whereas here they are playing in tbe gray area that they might have come up with it
I say call them out
Yeah fuck them
Oh ya I just looked at the follower count
would u have been down for it if they just lip synced it
I have been waiting for some kind of emo equivalent to having health insurance
Oh for sure yeah i mean its just straight up stealing but doing the bare minimum minor effort to make it technically not
"its annoying bc they also have a lot
of
followers and think they can get away w just saying follow jeff and assuming youll be ok w it"
Start a dialogue
Or better yet turn it in to content
Eric Sony and Hypnosis unpinned a 
I would dm them and make them feel bad
Eric Sony and Hypnosis pinned a 
Exactly And I feel in my heart of hearts they know this and are using it to their advantage
You can still say that now and be like I dont like this but they have like a dumb argument back or slight ammunition to respond against
Like if they didnt credit you you would have complete footing to say take his down
But I have seen this where people just straight up steal shit And they did the absolute bare bare bare minimum to credit you instead of straight up steal stuff so you cant really do anything about it without maybe coming off as a buzz kill
literally
Aldis closing by my work
Yeah its also weird considering Tik Tok has set a precedent where you can just directly lip sync over something
And they lift lines directly so its like not quite a lip sync not quite oc
I think you should cover one of their songs
but its annoying and weird
they def thought they were like being respectful by doing that i think
Which is intentional imo
soooo awkward
oh damn they tagged u in it
In between promoting their song and saying theyre neurodivergent
They credit you but its like buried in the caption
So weird
i would send them ur reel
i just saw someone copy a chris fleming video on tiktok and go viral yesterday and it was so annoying
oooooo so weird
Note they did not reach out to me in anyway before posting
""
Curious what yall would do in this situation
imma hit it up if anyone is interested 
pylon is playing at bric a brac at 
Of an otherwise genius idea
Question mark in the concept makes me doubt the source
Could be a great opportunity
Bobby was mid sentence ranting about Chicago cross streets some reason
They immediately got out of the car while saying thank you and goodbye
While driving Bobby and Paul home yesterday we were at a red light and Paul saw a liquor store and told Bobby we should get out and get beer
What a wild show
All of these women are in danger lmao
And the camera pans to some Funko pops
And he was like these figurines I get one everywhere I go
Hahahahahahahaha this dude just showed his fiance his house
Forget those bitches
Turning off Gilmore girls
Ok I will watch it John
Just say whats in your heart
How do I word an email to my uncle saying thank you for the hockey tickets and sorry if you overheard my friend Bobby screaming homo
Shes just hanging out making shit toxic
Its incredible
BRO THIS ONE WOMAN WHOSE GUY LEFT IS JUST STICKING AROUND
One more is about to leave
Hahahahahahahahaha  of the five guys have left because the women are too independent
They are unbelievably toxic
These Kings are so toxic its incredible
whats splatter
THEYRE THREATING TO BEAT EACH OTHER UP
Almost died
"We were in a dining area with my uncle who got us the tickets and im intimidated by

Bobby and paulie were yelling riffs"
PEOPLE ARE LEGIT FIGHTING
YOOO THIS LOVE IS BLIND IS INCREDIBLE
I was thinking of going to splatter the th If anyone wants to wait and go see it
MARRIED KING
My brother
Who got married
THAT KICKS ASS

Some of these dudes are scary
Lmao

Yo Im watching Love is Blind  Habibi its so good
Hahahahhaahha

Exact perfect person to do that with
It starts at Steppenwolf time
So Im chillin at home unless someones cooking up something good
Me too same I thought it was at like nine
See that was my plan but then o found out it starts in  minutes
Are people going to Splatter tonight
Its full Springsteen but for just Cleveland
Cleveland has a legit local Springsteen called Michael Stanley Band look up the song My Town
Its a good idea in theory
The SpringsteenJersey connection simply does not exist for most places
I like the idea that every place has a springsteen tho
Bruce is a unique case though
Smashing Pumpkins and John Prine were good too
Ideally it would be a musician but I think we are discovering chicago doesnt have one
Andrew quit teaching to become an infographic pollster
Plain White Ts is also Chicago suburbs but theyre one trick ponys But Delilah is like our Springsteen Wendy
Yeah so it turns out you werent looking for a musician
Both good choices
Bill Murray maybe more so now
Honestly yeah
John Belushi
I think more in terms of universally beloved
Both of those answers are lame for different reasons though
If we are talking Springsteen levels of influence it is either Kanye or Muddy Waters
""
Yeah that was the only thing
I couldnt get laid bc he was fucking all the girls My age 
Peet Wentz and got so much pussy
anytime someone said they didnt like woody allen she would just get so upset and walk away
You were right
In middle school I was like peet Wentz must get so much pussy lol
Thats what Im saying
I agree
Prereunion falloutboy rocks
Wait what
I might fuck around and watch this tn
i neeeed a movie night for it it was sooo bad
paris manhattan
Not anti pre reunion fallout boy just not stoked theyre the biggest
This aint a scene is literally about my life
What was it called
I will defend fallout boy the bass lines are so fucking tight
def want to watch this w the crew
and then a robber came in and he had a gun to her head and she handed him a dvd of Manhattan and he decided not to rob her anymore
My queen
Fuck it Led Zepellin
and hand them annie hall
heres the medicine u need
shed be like
and anytime someone was like i have a fever and the chills
saw a movie on the plane that was all about a girl who runs a pharmacy who is obsessed w woody allen
Oh I mixed it up with fallout boy nvm
Jolly beans Christmas album will rival all
The band Chicago and Styx are too
John prine disturbed and Green Day are Chicago alum
which was a bottle a night girl
decided im either going sober or fully drinking like i did in fwance
also just got home
The problems are that all of these people moved away
theyre literally from my suburb
its fall out boy
ohhhh yeah
If were going movies id say Michael mann
Oh wait it unfortunately may be Fall Out Boy
Joe Swanberg
Right well its a tough question bc if u said chance like  years ago youd be right but I feel like hes frittered away a lot of influence and good will
chance is he wasnt gay
Yeah Wilco is the biggest I think as far as rock goes
Chance maybe
i feel like he doesnt count
Ya or I was gonna say Kanye potentially
this
Honestly Our Springsteen is Chief Keef
Smashing Pumpkins are great
Like tweedy is maybe the biggest guy who lives here right
Idk there are people who are popularinfluential from Chicago but dont necessarily like live here or operate from
Yes
Music
Like how Jersey has Springsteen
Who is the best regional artist for Chicago
it cute
anyone watch da new dragon ball yet
Ian Erickson plz let us know about next time
I was too worn out from work to go so stoked for future Ian dj parties
Ian DJd amazingly it was a banger party
Had a dream I went to see Ian DJ 
Did we talk about this
my gorgeous solitude in france has been one for the books but i am coming home ready to grab a beer with my pals
brb flying home
Also if anyone is coming tonight its BYOB
I like the Ari remix but not enough gun lyrics
Hot take club classics is my fav on the remix
My dad called me and my brothers wedding speech long winded lets goooo
Thats the type of vibe and positive energy thats contagious
Letsgooo
Waiiit I wanna see Ian dj and that place is right by my apartment
In numerology it means good dj
Maybe 
I think  n central park was my first address in chicago
Wait
Maybe especially that
Even the hieroglyphic stuff
I like bon iver
Its at  n central park ave
Yeah the lineup is me
Where is it The website is being goofy for me
Do you have an idea when youll be on the lineup
Omg that Once soundtrack was nuts had everyone acting like theyd never heard folk music before
Bon Iver and the soundtrack for Once
I hate Bon Iver my mom got super into him after her divorce
Just like since his second record nothing hes done has excited me
Its not that I think hes bad
The Ari song is the best one
I love bon ivers stupid ass
Sorry joining discourse late but I think Ariana grande song is boring
Charlis verses are good but I feel like he weighs them down
Jonah we need to talk about this cuz I agree
Its like they did the   thing for every song on the album its so sick
Brat continues to give cant remember the last time I feel like a record got so much milage and i do love it everytime
Outshines the original mix in many instances
But I love their friendship
I just cant get into bladee
Amazing album
dont forget bladee
Yung Lean really surprised me to hes great on it
tbh i havent given anything a listen but i dont expect anything groundbreaking
And I like charli thinking about having a kid in the middle of her coke album
Noo Charlis verses were even better this time around
Yeah I think theyre trying to get stuff off the ground they did a comedy show last week
Sorry but he has to do more that throw some some blown out autotune on a track to impress me
WTF do they run shows there
Its one of the few where I think the original is way better and it doesnt even come close
I just really dont think he contributes anything good
But I understand the mid allegations
I disagree
I think the Bon Iver Charli track might be best on the album
Caroline polachek is kind of aping Kristibrigid notes app poetry in her feature bc she says free bleeding in the autumn breeze
But Volcano Choir was good Ill give him that
I just mean i think hes mid in general
havent listen to new charli
idc about him
Bon Iver is mid tbh
yes
Can I give a hot take
The Ariana Grande feature is everything I wanted it to be
Elliot gb and Bennets place on n central park
This looks sick
Where are you at again
Honestly gonna be a fun set up theyre gonna move the pews out of the way
How much time should I expect to do on this Braided show
its so good
""
Anyone want to talk about how sick the brat Remix record is
Come have a beer and hang out
Not sure how they are handling this but its free

its better to have a womens name on the entity still
Jeff must be so good at talking to kids about santa claus
so there really has not been any continuity errors in the KristiJoey breakup of 
yes that is the explanation
The name Kristi Durkin is like a doctor who thing so Frankie actually has that email address now So Ive been told
Delete this
Why is Kristi on this email  When Frankie is the new host
Ln I got stoned and kept saying this guys name aloud
The joke makes even less sense tweeted when hes saying it it at least kind of sounds like hurricane
Here I am rock me like a Burger King
Hahahahahaha alpha move

Ok well our account would be for promoting our show and being cool

I think what I say about John is fluid and Richie is trying to crystalize my words which is very akashtic which I am choosing to believe spiritual is a negative thing
I would never say that but Ian did
John you are basically a loser every day is what Ian is saying
But
Might go later But
John Ill make it up to you Ill take you to any mic in the city next week
I wouldnt say just this week
No

Only akredit
No we no longer accept akash here
any more akashicly spiritual criticisms of me edited
anymore akashicly spiritual criticisms of me
Do you think this guy has ever considered how smart he is
is everyone all caught up
and the mistake of erroneously declaring it an accident
i made the mistake of replying to someone on quora
Deeply spiritual people rarely discount historical evidences to the contrary
This doesnt seem accidental
i accidentally responded to something on quora
MAYBE to an open mic
I dont WHERE Im bringing it
Im taking my gun out
John hates phonies and I think he should do something about it
Lierish

Children can already vote
I can prove it to you mathematically
Its a very uncomfortable opinion to have
If anyone could help convince me otherwise Id appreciate it
Just saw a tik tok where a guy convinced me that children should be allowed to vote
I always thought that was an official offshoot

Us and sloppy Sundays Montreal are on very good terms thank you
Look at my lawyer dog Im going to time out
Nice to meet you John I agree that given the circumstances it would be in your best interest to change the name of your show Have you considered the name Sloppy Sundays
Great opportunity tho to introduce a new kid lawyer character into the frankiverse
Pal nobody is confused by that
Truly so funny to be like people will be confused by your comedy show and go there instead of our long time theatre show that is  blocks south of there
Thats like when that poke company tried to trademark the word aloha
I wonder if hes sending cease and desists to hot dog places
ive heard of headshots but this is ridiculous
Not sure if font is legible
You should do a Kanye fifty style where you both drop albums at the same time and whoever sells less quits music
Also can Frankie sign my gun
For a old style tallboy
Is it cool if I email him a picture of a gun
Change it to  first jokes
I think that case has wrapped up so he should be free

So any time a hurricane happens he tweets Burger King insert hurricane here
Paul has a bit about if Burger Kings were named after Hurricanes
First time I dont understand his beauty
I wanna know so bad
Can you help me understand
Hahahaha
Lorne Michaels telling all the women on the cast to smile more
Hes like funny guy we just need to get him some pussy
Now I just keep picturing Lorne trying to turn Bowen straight
I know Lorne paid or tried to pay for Steven Castillo to get acne treatment and I think asked him to lose weight to consider adding him to the cast
i did hear something fucked up about weight stuff from lorne but idk if thats true either
These types of dudes just rock
I have a friend like this
no idea why he made this but its awesome
just sent me this
This is one of the only people I talk to from high school
Could rock
Nation of Islam style
If he united the prison under one religion I think Id have to convert too that would be really impressive
""
What if car world guy goes to prison and then heavily proselytizing So instead of people finding God in prison they find Car World Nobody tell him this idea
Plus theres the whole JoeyKristi feud that everyone is very invested in
Wow some really interesting stuff in here today Down for Chinatown  karaoke
Amazing
Hard to get an exact headcount but I am taking the heart reacts from the last  at face value but well have a lil wiggle room if more folk wanna hop in
Also I dont know if well end up needing all of it but I just made a reservation for a private room for  people at Dolo Restaurant in Chinatown on Oct th at pm
To put it lightly
Dont recall exact specifics but a lot of it involves being pretty bad to women
one day I hope to prove this by gabbing with my girls while in an MRI machine
gossip is so good for your brain
And thats all I know
And science of course
All I heard about the friend is they are non binary pretty sure not william
I fucking love gossip
The lord hath answered my prayer for a bountiful day in the chat
I cant think of another reason she wouldve been fired she was doing really well on the show
Not a bit pretty sure
Wait whats the bad stuff you hot my attention
I want that to be true so badly
Which friend because that sounds like William Banks hahahaha
Or is this a bit
Really
Hahahahahahahaha
Ok I overheard in LA the reason she got fired was she brought a friend to the after party and they stuck their fingers in lornes food
The blackcent was egregious
Ill see him occasionally but he mainly performs on the road with Chloe
I saw him a few weeks ago
As far as I can tell
Yeah hes definitely not performing in Brooklyn anymore at least
Michael Hirsch I think
Oh ya I heard some bad stuff about him
I want more details like does he suck at comedy
who is Chloe Troasts boyfriend I only know the broad strokes
he learned it at McGill
They are keeping you safe
hahahahaha
I like to think its due to her boyfriend doing Blaccent
also wanted to be famous
when I was in sixth grade in catholic school I lowkey thought god was calling me to be a saint bc I felt really bad all the time but it turns out I just had really bad anxiety 
Do it while hes still a free man
Yeah and Id really like to talk to him about that
oh he would  start having delusions that he is a saint
Is it because of the construction
His whole new bit is that he really believes in god
Anyone know what the deal is with all the cops in Logan Square
Confession is lowkey kinda good for guys like that
I think hed like it
Id like to convert Will Banks to Catholicism
I fucked it up
UGH the bit is gone
Sorry wait Coles
You gonna be at crushes
just chillin before dinner decided to check in on the chat 
im gone this week
no
HAHAHA
Are you back in town crusty
What if this is the reason Chloe Troast got fired from SNL lmao She has the car world tattoo and they were like yeahhh we gotta let you go
i also wonder how much he cares about politics vs doing this new character tbh
haahahahahahaha
I was told hes dating a  year old Kennedy now so maybe hes got their machine behind him
but also its like idk dont date william banks tbh hahahaha
i bet caro feels realllllly weird
Looooool
Hard to do the country not religion argument even though its true
Oh shit thats right
Yeah I was going to say this could be tried as a hate crime lol
""
Ok going back to work sry for caffeine spamming
Just the worst person to support
Israeli flags which is good
What signs did he rip out in Connecticut
Nvm
Doing a photo shoot in a kimono gonna hold a sign saying this
Also idc it funny
When I go to Japan I wanna do a bit where I keep saying this is the only place I feel safe as a Jewish man
Something similar
in  I was jailed for stealing yard signs 
Jewish improv troupes are gonna get your ass
I think so
Still thinking about this sry
its very Manson of him good for the cult vibes
They were all Israeli flags right
To the community
That felt mean my apologies
Starting JailWorld
Jewish prison gangs are gonna get his ass
wait I thought it was it downstate illinois
Cant be too worried he still posted about the improv jam he hosts tonight
He used to yell at his son until he would live in our basement every now and then
It would be a respectable way to have to go to jail Kerry is right
Hes being vague idk
They must have all gotten together and sued him Like why is it going to trial does he mean local Connecticut court
This feels like a Noah Kahan lyric
Drove in my hometown and saw an old friends dads truck
Yeah i think it probably would but thats still just wild to even go to court for that
but that would kind of rule if he went to jail
esp if  months is like the max
I feel like the sentence could be lessened to like a fine or community service
Aaron Klinger when youre not busy unconditionally loving your son I wrote an essay about your question
if he acts like William Banks in the courtroom they will def make an example out of him
Right
Bit
But
Like that feels like it should be more of a dont do that again thing
I do believe its true but that seems like not a trial worthy crime Like wouldnt that be like a misdemeanor if anything I truly hope he has a lawyer and isnt going to represent himself for the big
Watching his life unfold makes me wondering if this is how people felt about Andy Kaufman doing his shit
It does feel insane to go to jail for taking signs from peoples yards
its like truly bravo level crazy
i loveeeeeee any william banks updates
He had a partiful link in his story for people who wanted to come support him at the trial and that feels wild to me
But if not true Even crazier
Very crazy if true
Im not sure if its a bit but I dont think it is William Banks is being charged and going to trial tomorrow for ripping all of those signs out in Connecticut tomorrow and the Max penalty is  months
Easter is on  next year
I mostly use mine for magic and emulators though but I did play a lot of kingdom hearts on it and that was fun

I already have dinner party plans for that night 
Heart  too quick Im gonna be out of town 
But honestly the schools on the Northside of the city are on the whole better than where I teach in NYC
And it seems like part of the issue is that covid funding is expired which leaves the district with a big deficit that will force cuts so I think theres a way it would get more money to the city Idk thats been an ongoing problem since may
But a big issue in Chicago is the school board is appointed and if Brandon replaces all of them it would be a decent stopgap while the seats start opening up for election

I love doing sketches with women and getting the comments
Man Im feeling so unmotivated today
 
Elephantnda Room
I think it did change the brain enough to where you can intentionally try to introduce new thinking patterns but I found the actual experience to be horrifying to the point where if Id smell something that smelled like the doctors office I would think of vomit
Dream night at the club
I found the experience to not be great I got violently high and puked while a psychiatrist talked to me
The goal is to get a more objective perspective on trauma and increase Neuroplasticity since the effects kinda linger in your brain
I went in twice a week where they would do nasal spray or injections and you would trip balls in a room where theres dim lights trippy stuff playing and a puke bucket
There was a time in Illinois where insurance covered intensive ketamine therapy
Andrew Shankland Luke Ipsum  how do I articulate to a friend why Chicago Reddit hates the teachers union

Hes cancelled
OK yes cool
is kristi back in chat lol
just play some other DJs tracks
try some bass nectar
I had it mailed to me but the tablets kinda sucked I think you want that shit in your veins
I think Ill be a lil more experimental try some new stuff at this one but take more of a bangeroriented approach to DJing after the witches of Eastwick show next Saturday
Also if you wanna do indoor ketamine dance therapy this Friday Im DJing at Elliot and Bennets place
I know theres people who do it at clubs but is it really a dance drug
So theoretically you could go dancing
I watched over Bruce a couple times when he tried it at home
Or are there take home options
Do you have to do k therapy at a doctors office
Driving now but yes

When south park makes me laugh it is harder
Its all kind of referential
Also family guy is funny but theres a kind of one note feeling about all the jokes
I kept laughing into mind of mencia
The al Qaeda cartoon at the end where everyone is eating poop made me laugh so hard
South Park not always funny frequently abhorrent but always interesting
Great episodes Not streaming on Max but worth going out of your way to watch
I believe an arc
It was multiple episodes
Its curry time 
Yeah joong bo sells lime leaves
Any reflective growth
Did anyone learn any lessons today
idk i think it would definitely take me  hours to make a  minute short film
I think we have a lot of good editors in chat i sorta wish people would post abhorrent premiere projects more often for us to dish about
It seems like hes using premiere as like a graphics thing instead of after effects

I was protecting my family
I believe Kristi
You gotta understand the rule was tyrannical
interesting
he hit me
Kristi has something theyd like to say to everyone
Okay weve talked it out
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer added Kristi Durkin to the group
For our small town it was viewed as incredibly disruptive
Our senior prank was instead of driving to school  we all biked
But it was like modular buildings with cement ground so it became an animal cruelty thing real quick
Some kids at my school tied an alligator up outside a teacher who was a big Florida gators fans classroom
I thought which way western man was just a book by a regular guy 
I only saw the phrase which hole
Sorry was quoting a meme I didnt even know was a nazi thing 
Mostly just a prank on myself
I didnt walk at graduation because my final project in western culture class was a video of stick figures fucking
yeah our senior prank was something like we put a pick up truck in a weird spot  no clue who the prank was on exactly
We had a dude that had a truck and the back had the confederate flag with the words raging red neck on it in Arkansas
But to me it sounds like hell
Always presented as some amazingly quirky thing
This was a town of  but surrounded by smaller towns without high schools so those kids had access
Its that and like stories of people riding tractors to prom
My school had kids who wouldve done that but most who would dropped out of high school by then
Rural high schoolers sound off
Did this ever actually happen
That but a bomb
So he spends all his time looking for pig  lmao 
And label it pig

Purge him
But Im working on it now
No

Holiest city in California

Christ is in the room during the sacrament
In any case transubstantiation is true
Im now John Grajdura
John Stockwell is a gd Mayflower name
Actually so funny for John Stockwell to remove Jonah for having too Anglo of a last name
This has sold me on Catholicism
Polish pride
Appreciate your discretion in this matter
Well see if Kristi does
I hope you and Jonah have learned your lessons
Thank you for not telling that story Richie
I always liked Chad
I wont even tell you guys about how my mentally challenged uncle started shouting polish equals stupid at church when the service they went to was in polish instead of English Im not even going to tell that story
Idk he was always very polished but yeah the context of his comedy leaned towards a conservative result
Creating fake arguments he wins with his daughters etc
There is a genre of comedy thats like they said this so I retorted with THAT and hes always loved that stuff
Dont really know the context but chad daniels was always doing conservative dad comedy  He does well live but I always thought of him as  kinda boring
Mischief Managed
 added Richie Owens and Jonah Eggleston to the group
Sorry guys I have the day off

Loving how safe the chat feels

Unfortunately I do believe a majority of comedians are conservative
It was bound to happen

Zako giving the bends
Joey post the pic
Doesnt quite fit but always want a reason to use this pic
This looks like if that Radiohead album cover loved jokes about kicking dogs
Wish I saw folks like this at my shows 
You gotta do a Frankie the kid comedian as an adult ai image
Zako being hype about this is really really funny
I truly believe this might be the creature that greets you at the gates of hell

feel bad
i acidentally made fun of my therapist for saying he wishes we can all be more costa rican like around politics
Wait you were on a college team w him
Very funny he was doing that online
during Covid a girl organized a struggle session via zoom for my college improv team bc kierron harrell wouldnt stop putting the women on the team into weird situations in the scenes he was in
Ive been waiting for this moment
calling a struggle session for the groupchat
but thats the leftist way
Ill die on this land I built
No time for in fighting
Please Im canceling John
Pergola fully repossessed

Sam go hang with a hobo or whatever you do
Something we can all agree on its good
Why cant we talk about porno
Really good name switch gang fully captures current chat
This is an emergency
Yeah you gotta call him
no he left me here to go play guitar lol
""
Its mostly fiber now
Coax cables are dead
Every time Ive had to transfer comcast from one place to another it has been the worst
When Chet asked you to setup the internet he probably just meant he wanted you to ask him
how am I supposed to know
is this a Internet
Incredible exchange
Yeah see you might be set up already for G or fiber and cant bring Xfinity
Didnt even have to do anything when I moved I think I could take this fucker on the road w me
I have a G thing and literally I just plug it into an outlet
Keep looking it gets crazy
Holy shit it has a basketball court
truuue fiber could be major bc I love streaming and downloading
Like fiber etc
To see if its already set up for something
Id look your address up on internet sites
Yeah thats gonna be unavoidable soon
the only thing is that its G so I will be transformed into a bill gates super soldier 
not sure Im trying to transfer my xfinity from my old place but also was thinking about getting Verizon internet which doesnt need a coax connection and has a three year price lock so maybe this is my sign
Catching up on boring chat
Or are you transferring yours
Do you know which ISP the previous tenants had
Thats the tough part
I have anxiety and adhd 
ugh but what if Im too shy to talk on the phone 
My guess is that youd need to call your ISP and have them enable it
yeah
Right those are the only two Ethernet ports on the back
Its the Ethernet cable that came with my router
Of the router
Which plug is the yellow plugged into in the back
Okay so the light next to ghz on the right should light up if its connected to the internet
I have this
Do you have a router
I can see the network on the drop down list of wifi networks but cant connect
The chat rn
I dont have the right dongle 
This looks good
If it gets internet then you just have to plug it into a router for wifi
Yeah just plug that mf in
like the Ethernet cable into a laptop
You might not need a modem just a router
Have you tried plugging that into a laptop see if you can connect
What does it look like Could be a fiber thing
Dont try to embarrass me in the chat again
Oh nvm GA is still available
Let me rephrase It is sold out
I could be wrong tho
I dont think so its like a  fee to have a dude come over and drill da wall
we can assess the property taxes 
chet left me alone to set up the internet which feels unfair bc thats Boy Work
Nope but I def wanna buy today
theres like a weird Ethernet box but no coaxial
In the spirit of being boring does anyone know if you can set up xfinity wifi without a coaxial hole in the wall
OMG BAGUETTE
is it sold out

apple martin named the group boring chat
With the way UaW is setting up all the contracts with the major companies to expire at the same time is setting the scene for what could become a general strike
The american labor movement is an incredibly interesting topic
one more word and the rotting plantain collection will pay the price
Let me be blunt is there a labor crisis in America today
Probably tied for the last time we had this conversation
Gonna keep this energy going
Does anyone here have experience filling out small estate affidavits for the Illinois treasurer
up there for the most boring conversation this chat has ever had
so it feels like everyones property is being undervalued
And prices were drastically lower  years ago
The big thing Im noticing is that like none of the properties Im comparing to appear to have been sold in the past  years
You were t kidding
"Comps should be within  square feet in size of each other and within like  years in age of the property ideally 

Also helps if they have the same number of units And you can use sales of similar properties if they were within the last three years And you can use your sales price if it helps 

And the land assessment doesnt really matter"
or senior exemptions
Like Im avoiding comparing to any properties with senior freezes
Richie Owens should I avoid making any specific comparisons that would just absolutely torpedo my appeal
Lower taxes pweez
They just give you a spreadsheet of comparable properties
Baby voice selfie videos
Im working on an appeal right now just going through different properties nearby
lol
Yall its weird how property taxes are tied to my core being
My job was appealing assessments for like  years
Im sure youre looking into it but you can contest it
I herd that multiple units increases taxes and youre comparing to big single family homes on the boulevard
Parents met working there
Oh yeah well I herd
I literally wouldnt be alive if it wasnt for the Cook County Assessors Office
Its all recent sales of comparable sized buildings
its driving me nuts
I dont even think they look at anything other than recent sales records and what the building looks like
And for kicking up all that dust
Youre probably paying more because you built that pergola
Looks like someone is going to have to cut back on Lates and Avocado toast
Im looking at properties that they compare my property to and Im paying more in property taxes than buildings that are literally one street away from logan boulevard and fully refurbished
your property taxes are tied to your propertys assessed value
Yo its actually pissing me off how arbitrary property assessments are
This would be such a good Halloween costume
Tony Hawk Tuah
Eventually all the nepo babies are going to have inbred traits like the Hapsburgs
I think everything is gonna be ok

Bizbuysell
Theres like  inches between the island and the stove
Stock can I tell you a website that you would love
lmao look at this wine bar that someone crammed into their chicago kitchen
Seen on HBO as in you have a Max account
But not as fun as the Lincoln lodge presents Agents of Chaos
Idk it seems like it could be fun
Im not doing a good job of selling it
Jk jk
Thats a  for you
What if im already booked on this and what youve said here has made me decide to cancel
it is an interesting thing to do when you could do the show far easier with  comics and the show would not drag on for hours
Here everyone puts Seen on HBO or something else and its like maybe you were on it but no one saw it
I live close but I dont want to see  comedians
Im gonna do that and just say I misspelled hobo if they ask
in  i just put hbo as my insta bio
actually im just gonna do that
i guess i can just say i performed at the den before tho
you and  other comedians can use The Den as a credit
literally why I said yes to the show
right plus you can be a scuzzball about it like that
jk its fun but ambitious and you can hit up chelsea hood if you want in
i want to use the den as a credit
its like a pyramid scheme basically
I just dropped the show and now Im being asked to recruit people
If anyone didnt get asked there is a oneliner show at the Den  that still needs like  comics
theyre going lol
You should reply yeah Only people should get to relieve themselves in the park Like I do
You should ask how they can tell the dogs and kids apart
These two dogs are not trained at all
I get mad when people walk their dogs off leash but in a park its fine if the dog is behaved Ive been to that park many times and its big the dogs play on one side and the kids play on the other Also Im  sure the signs dont say no dogs allowed
We went to Palmer park and saw the dogs
Everyone is mad at this one owner who lets their dogs loose
My gf tells me about Logan Square community page off leash dog drama
Im sick of people thinking their precious human child is more important than my dog no offense Aaron Klinger father of one
Id like the troll this guy in my neighborhood FB group ideas welcome
Theyll be back
literally is that game whoa

You should take The Substance instead of Botox
WOW

I stood in silence while all my friends planned to see megalopolis without me and now I am being punished
But some of our plans just happen to be sitting in the best row in the entire world to see the best movie of all time
We all have plans tonight Joey
If having plans on a Saturday is snooty then call me Frasier crane
Too snooty for row L huh
If anyone wants to join for a matinee and bring me mushrooms thatd be sick
I cant stop thinking about it
Fuck it Im gonna see megalopolis tomorrow
meanwhile Megan  I saw The Substance  I could describe what happens in it but i absolutely wont
I cant wait to hear what everyone thinks about it
Ive never seen anything like it
All I can say about it is enjoy the ride
I fully expect it to be a  star movie that I think is both  stars and  star
If someone asked me to describe what happened in it  I legitimately couldnt
I am genuinely glad I watched it
Dude  you will want to talk about it
Im so excited to see it Wanting to talk about it is all I want from it tbh
I could talk about it for hours
I genuinely dont think Ive ever seen or will ever see a movie like it again
Yeah thats truly good enough
So close enough

Great job Samy Dick my son 
Which is WILD because they have mics that are setup to do exactly that
Laugh factory clips do not pick up the crowds laughs at all
Like the laughs are so different from the stage
I genuinely feel like its just a lack of the microphones ability to pick up laughs well
Im like woooooowwwww
Its such an ego killer for me

But it was good
Im sure Im gonna review the footage and be like man I suck
It was fun
How did it go
I asked them to play throat goat for my walkup song but they didnt

Kristi Durkin is kpd at the Sox game I wanna build
Is coles selling new t shirts
Im always saying give it up for your hoes
Then we figured out she misheard me call Kristi the host 
A woman approached me after my set and said I shouldnt call women hoes
I think this happened bc I went down a chicago sex massage wormhole after seeing the new neighborhood spot
Are my followers all Johnbo Walter Stockwell 
Vouch should hang up a picture of me the way iO has pictures of Jack McBrayer
Is it true that MJ Lenderman is setting off explosives at the wedding

but i feel like that would mean its like a full commitment
it was like  each for party bud for lukes bday

I like that idea bc it sounds expensive
now hold on lets not be so hasty to dismiss a party bus to Lake Geneva
Utility bill deposits they never gave you back etc
Its like paychecks you never got etc
If u can get folks to pay a lil bit theyll set up an open bar

Kristi just sent me this powerpoint and theres no way she talked about Lana del rey for more than  seconds
hey thats fair thats me with anime
I guess any time someone said the name I just kind of glazed over and stopped paying attention
im carrying the back of my generation and u dont even care
I refuse to believe this
i literally did
god please say you didnt do this at crushes w me as cohost
I will say that my coworker knows shes NOT Latina but thinks she has Latina vibes I think for reasons that might be racist
"its almost like u didnt pay attention to my
powerpoint times im glad i didnt know who lana del rey was until "
Or were they p good
Worse than imagine dragons
i pulled this shit last year where were u
Also she suuucks live
Great name for a political consultant
Havent liked her last few albums but I think Norman fucking Rockwell is incredible
Popstar sensation Liz Grant
she chose the name bc she liked Miami
nah her birth name is Liz Grant
Like Los Feeliz
It could be that LA thing tho where maybe it has Hispanic roots but has been really americanized and is pronounced differently
Im sorry I know everyone is having fun riffing on the leaning tower of Niles I completely understand if no one wants to engage with me finding out about Lana Del Rey in 
Im sure Im late to this but I have never thought about Lana Del Rey or listened to her music on purpose
wait its crazy that you can choose an hispanic stage name
Specifically Niles
Oh he mentioned the Sears tower being a target didnt he
just learning shes not latina
Frasier
Niles
Fuuuuuck did he actually say that
This hair is cute tbh
My onozempic coworker who described Lana Del Rey as having Latina vibes asked me where the original leaning tower was located
Did you steal this bit from Conner OMalley
hshahaahahahaahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Death toll ish
Apparently one of the planes on  was meant for the leaning tower of Niles

Haha okay Ill hit him up
im lovin the headshot choice
yeah i dont find him creepy or anything  actually quite friendly  but if shes a comedian she may find him irritating
Those are all the things I know about him
Rovaughn tried to fight him at a softball game
He would constantly pester Adrienne about going up earlier at Schubas
Every week at lotties he would need some special accomodation
Yeah I dont think hes a bad dude at all but kinda weird
She doesnt sound wildly picky as its for  months
Curious if hes a decent dude but more so if she could circumvent the airbnb fees
Hes a very annoying guy personally
My Dutch roommate needs to find a place to move and hes doing a long term air bnb
Why
it absolutely is
I think thats a very old headshot of Josh DiDinato
I know him
Adam
Oh wait I think I met him at Madison comedy week

Shit is free
You should just use a Google voice number
"I have a soundboard with Bluetooth to connect directly
To a phone"
For mean car dealerships
I get a free phone line for a year and wanna have a dedicated prank call phone
Does anyone have an old smartphone they wanna sell to me

Samy Dick really great opportunity to start a show called Sam and Roe
Would be a good special name
Roetorious
Omg I wish I was this discussed on group chats
notorious roe is that anything
he may not be funny but he is the most talkedabout person i know
You know what he just earned a follow apparently I was not following him
I am committed to liking one of the videos if he ever makes me so much as crack a smile
This is how you get good
Im giving him a like and no share
Just incredible
That hes still fucking going for it
After posting that story today
I cannot believe
His commitment to these in the face of such backlash is truly inspiring
Charles Oppenheimer and I are both wearing sambas
You know how I feel about this one
Next one
Our Deepest Chimpathies
Just thought of a really good card you could send Jane Goodalls family when she passes away
This is fueling the speculation that she and McConaughey are an item
I think she wants to inspire the next generation of leaders
Omg and shes  years old
Why is she doing business talks
she lived in the woods with chimps
JANE GOODALL
HAHAHAHA

I have an Hn Pro zoom that I use for my podcast sometimes and have used for drums and audio on a short that I shot and it works well If you wanted to borrow it to try it out you can
Anyway to my HVMs Tiege Hanleys Vitamin C serum is a great way to give your face a nice alpha glow
It also presumably puts some wear on your bike
My old roommate budds would do this It worked okay but it was a bit loud and didnt like any side to side movement
Ethical fuckery
You can dig around the Amazon shop to make sure its not a small retailer through Amazon
Genius
You can buy one from Amazon then return it in time for Black Friday 
Thinking of getting a zoom
Does anyone have something they use to record audio at shows that they really like
V sweet do not tho
Klop if you have a switch Ill lend you ring fit adventure
Me and all my homies getting caked up this winter

Ill peruse north suburb fb marketplace for one
Just want something to crank out the calories while I watch tv
Ty
yeah stories are for crushes and exes
I do this constantly but Im looking to see if my crushes are watching
I have one it literally doesnt stink at all
I wanna get one but fear the stink building up
Does anyone have a stationary bike in their place
I used to a lot but really only occasionally
Can I get a suggestion of a celebrity roast youd like to see me do jokes at
he should be a dj
Long form king
What if hes in the wrong lane and would be a top tier improviser
I literally never look at who looks at my stories Is that a thing that everybody does
Because he has the time to look at stories all day
My dude is crashing out hard
He needs to get a new job
Why are people asking him what the worst part about comedy is so often
This could be so many group chats
who told brian roe
Movideo gamies
What an unbelievable idea
He says theyre gonna combine video games and movies into something even better

Rise and Grind chat lets get this bread
my twin towers
Concise competent movie
I thought it was good too
I thought there were parts they did well but there was a lot of stuff that took me out of it
I think I generally like it
I really liked it and feel alone in that sentiment
Mixed feelings
Just watched civil war for the first time
I have a spotlight its a pretty simple one Youd need to put it on like a table or something usually worked fine for dandy crown
Damn I am working I hope people showed up to Zanies of Old Town for  Michael Meyers
Damnnm Dannys show is packed the fuck out
Nice Id use a wonky set up if the rest of these phony haters fail me
Its for filming I assume it would work for a show idk
Its a light stand that I put together wrong but works
I have a pretty wonky set up that might work
Anyone have a spotlight with stand I could borrow for a show Friday
Totally Margin of error
Once could be an accident
Even once would be unacceptable

Youre a dead man next time I see you
Ive been hearing chatter on the High Value comms that someone was leaking the High Value Manifesto but I never thought itd be you Joey

No fucking way this is huge
The High Value Men HVM will make it look like I killed myself but do not be fooled

I want more content from the Salesforce Conference floor what is your part in all this Have you done any team building activities yet

Theres really something so amazing and funny about the juxtaposition that happens when businesses try to appeal to other businesses
Obfuscation is a critical principle of data structures and algorithms I just cant help it Sorry king 
Sorry bud
Bruce thinking about growing a long goatee
NYC cops shot a guy for fare hopping and accidentally shot another cop like the day after Shankland got stopped You should be grateful that youre getting paid at all
You would probably make more money if you quit teaching and became a cop
Gonna gripe for a second but since the nyc depart of Ed didnt fully process me as a teacher until the day before school started I have to wait until the th to get my first check and even then its unclear how much back pay that will include or how they are going to go about giving me backpack 
Bruce Bangers
Never apologize for posting bangers bruce
Sorry for spamming today I just see something completely insane every time I turn my head

Even better Im going to go into tech
ahahahah sam thats so funny the flickering florescents
This is like how David Lynchs whole thing is basically Im fucked up because I lived in Philadelphia once This is going to make you an incredible artist Sam
Its so funny they said I was going to work at one company but Im fully at like the public office of a public housing group that is kinda owned by that company
And now Im manning the front desk and its just people in public housing being pissed that their apartments are awful which is valid
Ive only met one person and weve sat at a desk all day and I have to keep asking questions about what is happening
Im sick of the cookie cutter corporate machine They want me to fit into their little SYSTEM what if I dont want to FIT IN
Sam is gonna go full Fight Club Cynical by end of week
Yeah Im hoping its not more than a week or 
Just book it
Im in hell baby

Love Danny lang
Anybody else going to watch Danny Lang at the lodge tonight
Maybe this ties into the egg freezing thing
they call their executive floor the ohana floor
I know the salesforce c suite is really into hawaii
But I feel like Salesforce is a place that Netflix will have some insane doc about
He just namedropped my friend Neil young
bruce can i use that quote on the record
Most c suites are filled with fucking weirdos
Salesforce is one of those companies where the c suite is filled with weirdos
Thats insane

The CEO just said he goes to Disneyland  times a year
Well kept yardmy mom wins awards for the flowers in our front lawn because my dad nominates her Sort of idyllic

My parents have a pool but theres no dilapidation
They all dress exactly how I wouldve guessed
I dont know these people and something tells me theyre not all that friendly
Just messing around
Yeah I know a couple out in the burbs theyre really friendly
Does anyone have family in the burbs or know anybody in the burbs with either a very messy yard or like a dilapidated pool Location scouting for vid
Cant wait to hear about how he leverages this experience into a growth opportunity
CEO of Tiege has shingles
Yeah that just seems like normal style stuff
Thats wild
Yooooo whaaaaatt
which is probably not for any weird reasons at all
my friend who works for salesforce says theyre very pushy abt subsidizing egg freezing for their female employees
Lol fr

Big traffic pattern reveal day on Kedzie Avenue guys look alive

So far we both mutually think protein per a dollar must be included
Should we include him doing stand up about his meal like its Louie show or Seinfeld
Literally
let him cook
Yeah Im projecting too much on it
Let him be weird thats one of the main selling points
Maybe Im overthinking it
Trying to figure out how to frame it where its not making him look weird in a negative waypunchy down
Were meeting Thursday gonna help him film a cooking show
who has told you that its fake
its his voice
Moonstruck and Witches of Eastwick are for the boys me and Joe Cariola
he makes me feel weird
i dont understand him
im so confused is it a fake voice
theres been no naval warfare in any of your plays dont condescend to me
wait which one am i
Is this because Kristi and John are our group chat democrat and republican representatives
Id like to point out that every show so far has been for boys almost to an excruciating extent
"

Especially pertinent to Johnbo Walter Stockwell and Kristi Durkin"
Makes sense I found out about this job yesterday at  someone didnt like it very much
I have or was told yesterday after an interview that I have a rd interview at a law firm to be like an admin assistant and boy I cant wait to call out sick to go to that
Started a weird temp job today that is in the office of a public housing unit and its roooough My trainer has mainly just kinda sat there and has already been in a yelling match there is no ac and the building is falling apart Yeah my life a movie 
Now you OWN your milkshake
Classic pre homeowner behavior
Classic tramp stamp style Elsie
Thats so Elsie vibes
Came here to say I was having a weird dream where me and a bunch of friends were at a pool party fancy house we actually werent allowed to be inside of so we all were crammed inside of a room trying to hide out from the homeowners and for some reason my boyfriends bandmate was giving tattoos Elsie How was there actively getting a full tramp stamp in a crowded room of comedians and I was like dang I want one too And she said Maddie um you like dont get tattoos I thought and everyone started bullying me with Elsie about it Apparently I was groaning and had to be woken up
Doing there will be blood at Fireside 
I wanna see Derek Begrudgingly do Master and Commander Far Side of the World
A mustache and script gets passed to you and you have to step in Joey that is actually a very good idea
actually what I want to do is make it like a game of freeze tag where anyone in the audience can take over the role of Daniel Plainview at any time
I volunteer to transpose That is my favorite film popular common opinion
Maddie Daviss stars obvs
do one for the boys
Matty Merritt Richie Owens next play
And then we abandon the boy Its Avis big debut and Movie screening
everyone dress as Daniel Plainview
TWBB night at the Perg
One of those movies I rewatched over and over and over again
It was my favorite movie for a while
Lots of interesting ideas about there will be blood here
can everyone
Oh every time I watch it I think its funnier
yeah I thought it was pretty cheerful on first watch
I love Mike
i just rewatched this and its darker than i remembered
The parody we deserve
he does kinda talk like Daniel day Lewis there will be blood
""
 leftist cred
He used to be Naomis landlord too she can vouch for Mike
definitely agree with the principle and if it was a company Id be like fuuuuuck them Though not to lose my leftist cred and be a lib cuck but my landlord is a nice guy and has helped me out a lot so I dont mind too much
No free lunch
Renters got rights
Or because theres just such a power imbalance
It just kind of annoys me that like the system is setup to aggregate small wins on the sides of landlords and its purely by virtue of folks just not wanting to deal with it
Like john I like going into a home improvement project entirely too confident and figuring it out as I go along
Itd be a bitch if I had all my stuff but I love a little project
Totally fair
honestly Im not that annoyed I move all the big stuff tomorrow and I think its actually going to be fun to get some beers and blast some butt rock and patch these holes in an empty apartment
I would but I honestly dont wanna speak on your behalf and I dont know the whole situation
do u wanna call my landlord and you can have a landlord to landlord chat
Exactly take some time to look into it so you have the ammo
Yeah it might be annoying to look over but if you have a copy of the lease you should see what they can hold you accountable for
No security deposit no recourse
Whole point of a security deposit is that they have some kind of recourse after youve moved out
You dont have to do shit
What do they have to hold you to patching the walls
Johnbo Walter Stockwell do something
which like what was my move in fee for then
theyll charge me
What happens if you dont do it
just got my move out check list and it looks like I do need to patch my walls Another L for failing landlord John Stockwell
Apparently baby Kling just rizzed up livvy
Oh did you guys hear
Hes planning something
I still have keys from shooting there I have to give back
Too bad about the space
Connor is so cool
All good if you offered
Nope but I asked Connor if I could and he said no
When can we meet it
Also hi tomorrow my baby is a week old
Wait did you pay him back or anything for the mirror
If you patched that up before you left I think they woulda been fine
Is it because of the mirror that I broke
this has been the caroline twyman gazelles an award show covering the most recent clip caroline twyman has watched

Any feedback on what to do with milk cat
When I had the opportunity
Didnt mean to do this but he was on the table so I frantically poured milk
Love Ryan but ALL he talks about is Grout

""
They should make Ryan Oliver the new host of Prairie Home Companion
soooo buns coded
Uptown taproom
AHAC
Cop dogs

Like it doesnt look aggressive at all but its clearly got some history behind it
You sound like someone who doesnt plan to take responsibility for the energy youre bringing into the space

i just removed the BS pieces and yeah used poly caulk ally status

I had to caulk the tub in my apartment like  times
I learned the hard way that using polyurethane caulk is so much easier than the normal shit
semi related i caulked my bathroom recently and it was a little fun
TEEHEE
JUST DOING MY JOB
valuable insight from a landlord
theyre supposed to use it to clean the place up after someone moves fill holes paint clean
thats what the movein fee is supposed to be fore
if they charged you a movein fee
imo if you dont have a security deposit theres no reason
Unless you like filling up holes then yeah do it
If youre not getting any money back na
also anyone looking for a studio apartment lol
moving out of my place and will have a bunch of holes in the wall from hanging things up should I fill them in I dont have a security deposit
Got my copy
Chimp Crazy is so so so so so good

 of the likes are from Brian roe or affiliates
I saw Beetlejuice  in D if you want me to tell you about it

Yeah he wanted me to do a Beetlejuice thing but I told him thats some Gen X bullshit and Ive never seen it
Howard the duck pleading for a sequel since beetle juice just got one
Additionally I think it would be really fun if you did that from the perspective of their accountant
And sort of helped us all understand what the hell that was all about
Oh what if you broke down the drake Kendrick beef

I got a little bit that might be worth trying
 reasons why this years event was the most adjective its ever been
Idk I was just trying to find a way to make it fruity
If Tom Skewers beautiful teenaged daughter told him about Brat Summer his head would explode
Like you almost have to avoided being too funny
I think you should pitch that and maybe do something about Brat Summer being over idk honestly pitching him is just a mad lib of buzz words
See Im wondering if I can just do Tom Skewer
Summer is almost over
Tom Skewer
But turned down my Boeing space idea bc they did it last week
Is the eating dogs thing political
He does this because hes afraid of how acerbic my political writing is
He asked me to do it tomorrow about an hour ago and said were good on politics
Maybe Kamala Harris where you dress up like s pro wrestler Kamala and do a politics bit
Tim Walz is in the news
What if i have an idea thats fruity but not crazy and entertaining
Like bearing fruit
He just means like fruitful

I dont think you did
You set the nickname for Johnbo Walter Stockwell to John Reactwrong
is OP on linkedin or fb
more like john reactwrong
I gave three emoji options that perfectly cover the entire range of reactions you could possibly have to my post but its not enough for this snowflake 
Green one got me 
Just wait til people find out what the red one has been doing in his free time
Its a good icebreaker and doesnt draw any political attention
Sounds good to me
Can match with whatever
It is snug in a nice way
How do you feel about it
How do we feel about candy hat
I was planning on taking John the same day for his bday lollllll see you there

Drove to the suburbs for Jonnathans old walker
This sounds like a kristi character
cant be a valid reason
who should we as a group chat ban for fun
hosting shows is awesome bc every few weeks or so you find out someone is a reallllllly bad person 
No I think it was Brian something
All these mannequin wannabes smdh
erik west
He was around a lot when I started  yrs ago and at that point also wondered why ppl didnt like him
He was banned too iirc
idk im throwing the crushes banned list on coles
Anyone remember that weird bald guy who did a lot of stuff with fake blood
i was confused why victoria let him up
Dude I literally was telling Victoria this
im learning so much about my community 
Anybody know who books Heaven
so like i never knew who steven curry was
its interesting bc like while ive been in the scene for like  years ive mainly stuck to this group chat plus like three improvisers who i tolerate
if u host a mic in this lifetime u get to go to heaven
Curry is still around Dude just go bomb in Austin already
being the coles host literally sounds like the hardest job in the world im not even joking oh my god
i was like hey can u leave ur set was sooo bad
coles is awesome bc im exercising sooo much forward communication every minute
it was weird
him and mike robinson tried to sign up twice
well idk if he was ever unbanned but he did go up last night and talk about fucking  year olds soooo much
Every time I see that guy hes like man people dont like me
i guess he was banned from sarah
man we just rebanned steven curry last night
You should be like I can actually ban you from Coles now too btw
Hahahaha
and then i said sorry dude i cant help u sounds like u dug a hole for yourself hahahaha
and then he started saying nonsense
and i said sounds like not well
and then he yelled at me and said hes apologized
i was like yeah u were creepy to people so they kicked u out
Also if you have a car take a drive through Malibu canyon road
Big fan of the planetarium at Griffith observatory

We are coming to Brooklyn TONIGHT calling all friends
Bada boom
The owner died
Ahhh I heard bada bing wings was amazing
Also a lil over priced but if youre down town I used to go to Jake Melnicks they have a ton of flavors
If youre going more traditional  Output all of the way
I think we talking stinky buffalo wings
Stinky saucy buffalo wings tho are different
Oh crisp is good
Ha ent had in a while and a lil far from the loganesque area
Crisp and Output are my favorite wings in the city
Oh love crisp
Has anyone said Crisp
Also
Lets do a buff joes trip football season is right around the corner
Has anyone had small bar wings
Oh yeah I got nothing in da city
Major major vouch for Buff Joes
I wanna go but we are trying to come up with local spots
Not the one on Howard
""
Buff joes in Evanston is a special thing if you guys have a chance
not gonna lie i did watch la la land on a  am flight on monday and i did cry
I remember liking it when I first moved here back in  but I went a few years ago and it def was not as good
bruce you should go on a tour of all the sites from la la land
harding tavern is literally one of the worst restaurants ive ever been to in my life
I remember liking the wings at the Harding tavern but havent had em in a while and I think theyre probably not as goodnot as good a value
You know its not terrible but I didnt hate the wings at Logan  I thought they were p solid
thank youu
thats exactly the vibe im looking for
Oh ya lotties is solid
oh shitt i forgot lotties has actual food
Theyre not paying me to say that theyve never paid me anything
Lotties
Fatpour is good
ughhh
Big booster of birds nest
Logan is kind of a wing desert tbh
i want to sit at a bar and drink  beers and eat flats
dine in
For delivery or dine in
not accepting judgement on my past just looking to be better
humiliatingly i only eat Hoots wings and i went there last night and they did me so dirty with the tiniest little wings soooo where do kids these days get good wings in beautiful logan square
I havent been but New Beverly that Quentin Tarantino owns and only shows movies on film might be cool
idk if u like ambient music but this series puts on reallly cool site specific shows and it was one of the coolest things I did in LA 
I felt like I was making a pilgrimage when I stumbled upon the Hollywood high  stair 
LA was so much fun to just walk around and do stuff
 cool and chill wine bar tht normally has good free jazz
Bob Baker marionette could be cool
Ernest debs park in highland park has good hiking and its not at packed as Runyon or Griffith
Walts Bar is the one bar I went to in LA that I liked Pinball and hotdogs
Im gonna be in LA for four days with zero plans other than getting drinks with the shrimp boys what should I do
PERFECT IN EVERY WAY
It WAS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY

The dentists GOLDEN BOY
I didnt know we were still at the dentist
Im so sorry
Im sorry to mislead you but in my defense I didnt think youd come at me like that
It actually is the dentist still
Get ready for the scolding of your LIFE
This aint the dentist fucko
I know I explained it to him and its like dude i already paid its not my fault the system does this so I cant pay for homeless people or something
Like maybe read the fucking room asshole Youre literally asking for a good reason
Turns out Im a rascal
They saw a soft white boy and they were like nice I get to dominate
Yeah the subway only lets you pay for  scan usually and then it wont let you
Waiting for the doctor to come and congratulate me on my excellent breathing
Hahahahaha what
Heres a damn pic
Luv u
Draw a pic not reading this
Feels good to do the right thing 
So I went up to these cops because I didnt want a ticket for hopping it and I said can I And the guy got pissed and said no you may not and told me to use another card and then I said I didnt have one and then told me to use a metro card and I dont have one and then we stood there for a minute and the lady said ok just go dont do that when we arent here and I got to say thats why I asked
Im on the subway and took the wrong train but it was only a  minute walk back so it was quicker than waiting but when I got there my card wouldnt let me in because it thought I was paying for more than one persons ride which is a weird thing to police
So funny that they worked out for  minutes and think that honored people haha
Maddie Daviss when does your band play tn in brooklyn
I dont trust anyone who calls themselves a dr of laughter unless its the guy Klopp keeps posting about

Every year I must remind people that despite being  years old I have no memory of

Hahahaha you were  years old you neverremembered

okay wait one more thing my fave  fact is that they were filming the real world Chicago during it and during the actual attack they were taking promo photos at wrigley field but they made them go back to the loft they all lived in and showed them the footage and filmed their reactions

Hahahahaha
hes the Dare of lincoln lodge
we need to just add him in the chat
Like some looney toons anvil shit
Exactly
like stretched in a taffy machine
Hes Long Stockwell
Different builds though
Johnbo Walter Stockwell is Brian Roe confirmed
ok going silent in chat for another  months
he literally looks like worse john stockwell  me
yeah like this was before he opened his mouth and im literally valid
Got an interesting face
it was the looney toons bball jersey for me
Perfectly fine looking guy If he had a good personality he would in fact be hot
i literally get it
no like i saw something that one night that i never saw again
Saturday at the lodge an unbelievably hot woman was fully enamored with Brian She followed him around the whole night
in this essay i will
Ok heres my hot take When people are like can you talk about something other than standup it gives the same vibe as people who hate small talk
not so much is different between brian roe and an alt comic when u think about it
Maybe we arent so different after all 
brian roe and alt comics are obsessed with talking about stand up
the lil beekeepers son pinned a 
I do love that people are still just trying to rip off weekend update but with no new bit
Its not about how long it took him to write these jokes Its about the literal years he has spent honing the craft of standup comedy that makes Laughable News possible
well that one guy farted in my bed and i was like wait im lesbo
i was also so sexually attracted to william banks
If Im not fully horned up for Geoff the peak of men how will I even look at other men
and now im doing ok and fine
and then i thought i was a lesbian for a month
one time he ran past me on the street and i was like omg hummanah hummanah
This is way funnier to me
Geoff is at least good at standup and confident
I had to say he wasnt and you wouldnt believe me
i also thought geoff asmus was hot too
Or what if he did Olds News and did the same style segment but it was about news segments from all of history
yeah other people do care about comedy as much as he does but also they  get better
Yeah it is funny to say its a scene issue when the issue is this is lazy and so unfunny
i cant believe my first open mic i told sam i thought he was hot
I would feel bad for him but I dont actually think hes trying that hard This cant be the product of hours of writing
Laughable news is really hard to digest
He really needs a new title
I never share Brians videos I screenshot and talk about them privately
Bad news for Roe
This poll is no longer available
You might as well be taking a shit on the bean
When you mock Brian roe you are basically saying you hate Chicago

The old CVS across from lodge between Concord and wasabi
which building
I dont have hard confirmation but the building did sell in March and she told me that was the plan for it
I heard about it from my real estate lawyer
how do we know about trader joes
Come hang at lodge tonight havent seen folks for a bit bc of my footankle 
On best night ever
I will come see Joey dazzle dazzle tho
I cant get myself to wait for hours at a mic
The breakdancer
Now this sounds like a late s pg teen comedy
its actually so punk to not know about Raytheon
Joey just saved the band
You dont need to know all the names for the machine youre raging against
Tbh I think its fine
To be fair Ray Theon sounds like they could be in a punk band
Seems like a cancellable offense in the punk world you guys cant tell anybody
Whoah thats gotta be like huge drama for a punk band
In DC and just learned my guitar player has never heard of Raytheon
Trader Joes in Logan Square is the final stage in the Lincoln Parkification of the neighborhood

Thats incredible
By the really cool mural we all love
Fuck me
I think its the building across from lodge
wait I want more info do you know where
the difference between someone throwing a show at the cellar that youre on vs just being on the pm show
Nobody gets passed at LF because nobody is really watching the shows the manager just books randomly same as zanies most clubs in NY have a more clear cut audition process
I think it means more in certain scenes than others bc Chicago doesnt really have a traditionally functioning club
Yeah they can do official shows there and can be paid
I still dont understand WTF this means when people say it Like does this just mean that they book you Are bookers explicitly going around telling people theyre passed
Reading the guy next to me on the trains texts chill and he called someone a curry cooking cunt and while thats horrible to say its a pretty great alliteration

She was like I bet he doesnt have any wrinkles or anything
She didnt see the wrinkle
He deceived her with his headband

why would she have sex with that dude
Zako cant love
Yea LA comics were messaging ppl here like who is this piece of shit shes talking about

getting a little repetitive 
"Bears game tomorrow 

Might bring the tv outside if its nice out"
Theres just no saving this place
Im so done
This is the last year Im doing it
Im done with chill Murray lol
Wheres the hang tonight
Sophia set her own nickname to kidult kidadult
like a guy whos biggest political belief is that America is on the decline because women stopped wearing evening gloves is soo funny
right like I love that the factory is a glove factory and hes so obsessed with the gloves and like how theyre made and the craft of it but its just like literally who cares nobody wears gloves anymore
Also a very good representation of how the middle class things about capital
Yeah absolutely I think its also funny that for the Swede its like she killed  people but will immediately write off any kind of mass killing done by America Theres several parts of the book where he kind of completely writes off some sin of america and then the next paragraph starts obsessing over the doctor again
yeah I feel like the parents stuff was great and like there were even some moments with the daughter where I feel like it was interesting that they didnt make the Swede like entirely dismissive of her cause and like tried to be a bit sympathetic of like allowing her to stay with those friends and like after shes gone like feeling guilty about moving the factory out of Newark which like carries an interesting paternal thing but then theres points where  hes like maybe I shouldve just like been way harsher and I feel like its a really good like representation of liberalism
The guy can write though it was like Wow what if John Irving was actually good
This is kind of exactly how I felt
yeah I totally get that I havent really read any of his other stuff but Ive gotten the impression that hes kind of like a grumpy old dude so I feel like hes able to diagnose but not necessarily prescribe anything for these problems
I did like the relationship with his parents a lot I thought that was very well done
But Im planning on reading some more of his stuff because I feel like I need to get a better understanding of him as am author to appreciate it more fully
Yeah like thered be a lot of parts I really liked but at the end of the day it bums me out to read something that really nails the malaise of america but doesnt ultimately land on any cause
But I feel like hes really good at writing about like the failings of masculinity and like that ties in a lot with like the idea of american decline
I feel like its less of a decline of the American dream thing than realizing its an empty thing all along Bc theres so much like striving done by the Swede to like be this waspy all American guy and almost like all the stuff that falls apart feels almost like his punishment for trying to assimilate so hard But yeah I do feel like the treatment of the daughter is a little harsh sometimes but its also like filtered through the narrators persona then thru how the narrator imagines the Swede to have taken things so I feel like youd never really be able to know what Roth himself thinks
I actually liked the daughter and it seems like he has a lot of contempt for her
Like the prose is good and Iiked the imagery but at the end of the day I cant really tell what he considers responsible for the decline of the American dream
I liked it but I cant really figure how Roth feels about America lol
oooh whatd you think
I finished American Pastoral and would like to discuss
Chicago style was excellent
Was Brigid mad that I never once got back to her about learning some stupid dance routine for this
Rarely used volleyball net in wrightwood park if anyone wants to play more before it gets cold

Theres probably also a business deal they sell to use the Microsoft suite of services
It integrates with outlook and other Microsoft stuff
Bad for calls
Its okay for chat
like its really easy for the IT team to just use it rather than set anything else up
I feel like its gotta just be laziness
Its a wonder why any organization uses it
It all runs so slow the entire suite
It really is
Microsoft Teams is so ass

I mean its so gd funny he lectures about eating pussy now
"Matt brown randomly told me he was above me in the scene and I said thats honestly kind of a douchey way to talk

Then he told me my reaction was because I am homophobic and racist"
I wish in this moment you kept that personal invasion
Felt like a personal invasion
But I deleted it
I took a pic of his lock screen last night because he left his phone at LF

Kristi if it were that we would not be texting the group chat
Love conquers all
He saw the error of his ways 
hes gotta be identifying as a lesbian im shocked to my core
He is in a heterosexual relationship with a girl who just looks like a femme lesbian
He is exgay
No
sorry late to game
wait is he just identifying as a lesbian now
hmm he was always nice to me 
Waiting for the YouTube episode to drop for my cousin
Hes been incredibly rude to me as well Also annoying
But he has also always been a dick to me so maybe I am projecting a bit
I mean I think exgay is a bit but hes just kinda always straddled the like
Is he like Im dating a woman because Im bi or like Im straight now
Jk
Whats that supposed to mean
To be clear he still acts extremely gay
Thank you for understanding the gravity of the situation
Thats so funny to hard pivot away from being gay
I think they were making babies and I saw one of the babies and it looked at me
He was making kisses with her in the green room
Hmmm actually idk if I would
Like if I was gay I would do this
It has all the signs of an elaborate bit
Hahahaha this is really so funny
Youre trying to make my head explode like a guy in a cartoon
Ive convinced myself you all are doing an elaborate bit
My mind cannot accept this
I dont think you guys are understanding how jarring it was to hear Matt brown talk at length about eating pussy
Ive decided Im only going to like the things that I really TRULY like in this chat
Gay is more like a state of mind really
Thats kind of a pronoun
Wasnt he going by miss brown for a while
Wasnt worried about it until he became exgay
Oh he just says shit like I dont do pronouns i have a job
What was this again
""
Just heard Lindsey porter tell a bat joke
Between that and the pronouns shit I truly think he is going down a dark path
Matt Brown came in looking like he was doing drag as a straight man and then talked for four minutes about how hes dating a woman
Also do people know that Matt brown is in a straight relationship
Fucking sellout
How are the fresh faces
Sorry Im in the laugh factory thats what I think is funny when Im here
Damn hes really starting young
The only thing we knew at the time was that he was getting divorced
Is this why you fart on your uncle

lmao
Zako goes Austin style on dogs yeah teamzako
I like him hes never been annoying to me tbh
St James is fine
I just read that this morning and I was tired and wanted to check
is there a comedian in the scene who kicks dogs
St James is welcome at bball far as Im concerned Hacks welcome
I think st James touched a cum rag Idk was focused on the game
Why not just do Popeyes and dj
Weddings are kinda stupid
What is St James deal also Why is he bad Im sorry Im out of the loop ANd I dont ball
Wait is there something else that happened besides them showing up out of spite Did they talk to you or ignore and only play with the game on the other court
isnt that awesome

ok wait sorry just caught up and read it all this is so crazy that humboldt  am has turned into a war
i need more info on bball
I believe the official start time is after Jonahs
its getting kinda late
i guess you can still ask for his location to keep an eye on when he gets home and its ok to move in
 w medill  i was gonna guess that
i was gonna suggest ask if he can share his location with you so you dont have to ask specifics
ask if its brunch potluck vibes or evening apps vibes
i love a mystery
love him
lmao
he messaged me that it was at his place today but no address or time lol
house party or at a bar
Definitely did it on purpose lol
or just clueless
wait did saint james do it on purpose
I dont think hell be back again
Like youre not doing anything but showing how dumb you are
Which is whats so funny
Thats it
Hahahaha yeah
Ya what was the details They just played at the other courts
like ok calm down
yeah i had a feeling when he was like im coming
hahahah oh
what happened w st james
The sadam effect
Andrew and Dunne leaving created a basketball power void akin to the Iraqafghanistan war causing  Isis
I will be reading American Pastoral but the other recs will be added to the list ty all
Big brain didnt realize
Like this  if I should get enough wings for you
Anyway Im grilling wings at my place at  and maybe folks can go to Jeffs afterwards
You handled it well tbh
No you didnt cause a mess He should have been kicked out the day he was put in
Genuinely
No thank you so much
Sorry for causing a mess
I kinda doubt he shows up next week But ya maybe well move to the north courts
But this is a war against people who are mentally unwell in an unfun way Theres no knowing how far theyll go
Gonna pass out adderalls if he comes again and well just lock it in to focus on our side
I just meant a new location in Humboldt Always Humboldt
St James and Noshod live like  to  minutes away
One more at most
No its Humboldt  am a new location cant happen Its a war of attrition We will win
I dont think itll stick his spite will tucker out
Nah I really doubt theyll keep coming the location is so inconvenient for them
You handled it well
Maybe we do new chat new location lmao
Those guys already hate me anyways
Make me an admin Ill go scorched earth
Cant invite LF comics anywhere smdh
If St James keeps coming Im gonna invite him to play with us every single time
Like if youre gonna try this Im gonna ignore it and make you feel stupid
Buddy making ppl uncomfortable is the whole issue how can you not get this
Which is kinda why I invited St James to play with us while hes here
We had a awkward little exchange but then he walked to play with the other group
Yeah I had a feeling he would show up out of spite
Yeah he is a child
I think the idea is to make folks uncomfortable
Basketball has been compromised
Haha noshod is there This is ridiculous
Thats such a St James move
Ok so St James definitely invited that group to ball on the court with Noshod lmao
That he is not marketing well
Yes but also I think Jeff Brumfield is having a party tonight
Would folks wanna come over to my place if I grilled tonight
Going to studio with a couple white rappers from st paul later so I will be well rounded on art today
I picked up American pastoral a couple weeks ago from that used bookstore near lodge so this is good to here
Theyre playing one more game I think
Its winding down
Do you think people will still be balling in 
What are the sides for the war
My props got spikes
Ive used timer lights where the onoff states were confusing
What do they look like
bc i leave the house at like  am and its  pm
which proves that i didnt turn them on
and theres an option for a timer switch last six hours and its always on that
Ok tbh it sounds like you havent figured out how the candles work
and i cant really put my finger on what it could be
and its happened like  times
i have three electric battery operated candles that i dont turn on before i leave for work and then i come home theyre all on
Its just called having haters
but im absolutely being haunted
but i dont even believe in ghosts
ok but im clocking in so ill tell u in five hours
least book i read was the flick by annie baker
Like i wanted to be an English teacher when all I knew was school
Go on 
i think im being haunted
That seemed like where I was going but then I realized you didnt have to do school
Very like stimulating discussion vibes in a good way
You would be a great English teacher actually
I would teach Plot Against America in a high school English class
It was my first of his but I could see myself becoming a rothhead
Plot against America is a good book
I like Phil roth
Its abt a girl bombing a post office in the sixties which feels shanklandcore
last book I read and liked was american pastoral by phillip roth
What if he asks you questions that could lead to some hilarious answers
Why
Hahahaha maaaan I dont wanna play basketball with St James

Thats nuts
Bad bad person
Everyone that gave him opportunities hes just spitting in their face
Hes just a massive pathetic fucking loser
Dude apparently he burned bridges at laugh factory too
Austin sucks

Also its really funny to burn a bunch of bridges before moving too Austin
Says a lot about a person that as soon as he moves he burns a bunch of bridges

these might be too kitchen coded for my bathroom
Kinda faucet bragging
Why did you show both faucets
also called me transphobic for doing a show at the annoyance which is so funny
but she didnt book sagr houston and the argument made no sense
gwen went after cassidy for not booking her on promedy and booking sage houston over her
Higher quality but less functional
like nightmare blunt rotation
its like me gwen rose vik pandya
This the other one
ok be real is glitterus actually a good show or should i just drop
If only detectives werent cops could be pretty fun lol
so crazy
Full circle cum rag confirmation its Mattys
Its not like the best retracting faucet but it works
I have one in a box that looks like this
I have a new one and one thats used but Im definitely never gonna use
send epics
Cross examining now every novelty cum rag has its own fiber pattern like a strip of duct tape
Matty Merritt analyze
Literally me
Bruce screenshot the cum rag  and lets see if its Mattys
Hahahahahahaha
Oh yeah I actually literally do
Also for everyones awareness MVP Aaron Klopfer went over and checked on them that day
Got off work at whiskey restaurant just to clock in at cat sitting conspiracy shop Could be Im connecting the dots too fast
Whaat I didnt know it was her rag
Unless multiple people have cum rag novelty towels
ATTN the picture of the Cum Rag towel came from Mattys house where she was ALSO ignoring the cats at the same time You guys have a lot to talk about Fuck a basketball chat play I want to watch the Gwen Rose cat sitting true crime doc
Thank you Jonah I have literally not been coming to basketball out of fear that he would show up
And I dont baffle easily
I was baffled
But not a funny enough joke excuse If its a bit Like whoops I dropped the ball and almost let your cats die but at least let me make you laugh  No logic no sense just casual animal neglect and subtle bridge burning
No its insane truly
Well she didnt check on the cats
And like if she had said I cant watch your cats because Im having an anxious episode I would not have pressed for details
Was that supposed to be a bit Or a legitimate excuse What is happening I feel insane
Listen you might not like that Im neglecting your cat but youre gonna love this terrible bit
Very obviously a gag gift or a prop for a show that someone just kept using as a regular towel
I dont get it
And then sent me a pic of a towel that says cum rag
She said she couldnt leave the house bc she got tricked into touching a towel
sorry im like woah shocked
she did that to matty
Wait Bruce yes I think maybe you mentioned it And then when I heard the Matty story I was having Deja vu
did she come in once and then never come back check in on them
Thats crazy Cant believe you never told us that
Yeah I might have told this already but it was completely ridiculous
she almost killed mattys fucking cat
she did that to matty
WAIT BRUCE REALLY
She abandoned my cats at Christmas do what u gotta do
People that I feel bad for but also make me feel bad
I agree thats a tough feeling Like there are plenty of people that make me feel like that in Chicago
but i dont want to drop a show bc of that
and im sure being her is hard i feel bad for her tbh but i just like dont enjoy the energy at all
shes been so mean and cruel i really dont like being around her
not the please like this
noooooo
Haha this made me remember that two days ago Gwen sent me a reel of hers asking me to like it
shes like gone after my entire friend group and actively bullied them and im like nooooo i dont want to be in a room w u girl
while were on this vibe
i dont want to do a show with gwen rose tn
Ahahaha
jonah im submitting u to the gazelle shout outs for this one
Oh sorry to be fair I am just calling him autistic
Unless one of you acts up
Probably my only act as Admin
thats so funny i didnt realize he was autistic i thought he was just a huge improv fan
Jonah youre cool as hell for banning noshod immediately
Yeah Giuseppe has some hilarious moments
Hes a sweet guy
Fuck him for making fun of Guiseppe
People talk Joey
oh my god
It was so mean spirited Told him to talk so he could keep making fun of his voice
hey man we kicked u out we hate that u sat on the stool
Its literally called stand up
ahahaahahahahaahahahahah
The biggest crime of all
And he sat on the stool
thats so annoying
Idk why Shankland would have heard of this
oh noooo he was mean to him
When for once I wasnt
Yeah And to say oh we were all making fun of you in the corner
Giuseppe
That nice autistic boy
Oh yeah
No the being mean to the guy
Ahahaha what did he do at schubas
Are you just talking about his boring ass set or did something else happen
With choreographed passes and drama
i want to hear what happened at schubas god dammit
I meant OF basketball Like I want to see Comedy Basketball play out like a basketball team drama
Im waiting for someone that actually knows what happened to explain since I dont want to talk out my ass
Im driving and need something to pay attention to
Context pls
speak on that
his set is transphobic
I want to see a live stage play or Basketball
"Make every woman I know uncomfortable I say nothing

Make me uncomfortable NOW we got a problem"
I heard about the schubas thing out here so you know its fucked up
Do tell
what did he do
Plus he did some stuff that pissed me off at Schubas last night
Yeah When he wasnt speaking in the chat it was whatever But once he starts thinking about showing up then its no good
Always knew Jonah had it in him to protect the community
I for one will not be impressed until Jonah calls Noshod out in public
Damn what an eventful day
Yeah Jonah speak for the community
maybe he should hear more of that
idk i think u could not reply but also nothing wrong w telling him he makes people uncomfy
jonah ur soooo real for that
busy
bush day at work was thinking of the chat the entire time
wait i really need to catch up
I need to know what kind of sick shit and power moves go on in the basketball chat
bat symbolism
Jonah face entirely covered by a cloak I can do what youre afraid to do
at first i thought stockwell hacked jonahs account
Wait Jonah amazing
good stuff everyone
Just getting caught up Bat thing amazing and Jonah removing noshod seconds after admin approval is hilarious
God this chat is so funny lately

Bat remover John bad vibe remover Jonah
idk i think this could send shockwaves thru the community
luis invited a few ppl 
i feel like the etiquette is not to invite people to something if youve never been
No right or wrong way Im sorry if this is adding any stress
So true
In my opinion
Dont answer you dont owe anything
Idk what to do
Excited for the Jonah Noshod beef this fall

Ty Caroline Twyman Jonah Eggleston
the picture of a glass of water makes this even funnier
hahahahahahahaha
Just got off the plane to get rid of the bat long flight came from Cape Town really wish I got the WiFi so I knew John took care of it
the way im demolishing the accept button
It was very harrowing
These free sound effect descriptions go hard
is anyone here over  years old i think im not eligible
collective sigh of relief
alright im all caught up on the bat story
aaron  likes klopfer pinned a

They wear out quicker than you think they will
He can campaign there all he wants he will never win the electoral college in basketball chat
Speak on that
I like docs tho
I have a whole annoying thing about docs
Im thinking about juicing up my height for the fall
Do we have any feelings about redwing boots or doc martins
He might flip battleground chats now
Johns poll numbers took a big jump since bat

Gonna throw toy cows in the air
thats dangerous
youre the closest to the twister
Front row twister DX tickets tonight
Huge day
 perfection
They remastered them
I cant say enough good things about Costcos Kirkland jeans
Id be game to go
Building a pergola has made me realize what really matters in this world 
Really appreciate you saying this
how did the bat get in
the video is nice
How did I miss the bat chat
Anyone going to Fantasy Quest 
Kerry Anthony named the group bat chat
thats so true
Something changed in him once he built that pergola
John has really gone from zero to hero these last  months
but saying goodbye to the bat that put up no fight was very sweet
i knew how the video ended but i was still nervous the bat was gonna escape  torment john at some point
It was one of them mytosis looking mfs
Im already on the hunt for this fucker
The police can finally lock this fucker up with your help
Anyway ID the bar please
Mostly he just honks at Wendys employees
Sometimes John decides to stunt on us all by reminding us of his generosity and willingness to drop everything and help his friends out of a jam
And then I had a CRAZY idea 
I shared a nice video of Tootie first
sucks  suck
the escalation from honey almond butter hot dog to bat bag was so swift
Welcome
But in all seriousness thanks again John Me Kari and my boys really appreciate it
Hahahahahaha
The video was heartwarming this feels like a misstep
OMG theres a bat in my house now
Thats how Ive always talked 
Johns Mickey Mouse voice at the end was also an interesting creative decision I wonder if that was ad libbed
So I had to sorta do a very scared reconnaissance to find where the bat was
So I was sorta stuck in my bedroom not knowing where the bat was or how to deal with it
Ya they were chasing it
But then I peaked open the door and the bat was flying around the hallway and idk if folks know our layout but the Halfway is right outside our bedroom and there isnt really a good way to get to any windows or doors without it
Had the cats noticed the bat
No sponsored ads Yeah that is the real mystery how did it get in and what are the odds
I quickly ran and got my cats and snuck them into our bedroom
CHICAGOS BEST LANDLORD
It was just freaky bc we got back from dinner dont know how it got in and was flying around our apartment
It takes a village John is trying to win Best Landlord in the Chicago Reader and putting up a pretty decent campaign
This was a very wholesome way to end my night nice work everyone
He is my landlord now
John really helped me and my family feel safe in our time of need
Also Ian was wearing a bullet proof vest for some reason
The bat may have been Kari
I did NOT see Kari
I wanna be clear
But fortunately for its sake it didnt struggle
I was ready to use centrifical force to keep it in the bag
It was like this
How did you get it out
That wasnt a normal bat
It was like a full grown parrot
That was no joke the biggest bat Ive ever seen
Just got word that the bat painted a fake tunnel on the wall and Ian ran right into it
This is beautiful and awful and I am following along like I assume they did on the OJ car chase
Im buzzing you up
Hohn your the best
Landlord is here
We already did that
I would try and get the cats in your room then open the back door and try to chase it out
Johnimal Control is coming
Animal control cant send someone over till morning
This isnt a normal bat
Ok I just got inside and now were all trapped in the room
they prob have done this before
have u called animal control
Ok Ill come by lol with some brooms and stuff
But part of this is problem is we are trapped in our room and theres like no brooms or anything super helpful to deal with it
This is why bats dont support front line workers
I really would love a hand I dont really know what to do
Im coming over Ian Im bringing stakes garlic and stuff to maybe catch a bat
I want to see a pic or video of this bat
this is actually Ian and Kari slyly revealing theyre vampires
BAT ICE CREAM
ALTHOUGH WHAT IF MORE BATS FLY IN
I used to get bats in my cabin when I worked at summer camp and the most effective thing I found was to open all the doors and windows and bang pots and pans together
Easier to clear out bugs than bats
Also alternatively just turn off the lights and open a bunch of windows and let it fly out
Ive been looking into buying a strobe light for a video thing and a lot of the reviews say they used it for scaring away bats so maybe you can do that
We can capture it and set it outside
Ok do you want me to come over with some tools
Hahahahahahahahaha Ian
We are sorta walled off in our bedroom were not sure how it got in here and its flying around our hallway and I dont know how to deal with it
Also update almond butter and honey sandwich on hotdog bun was good
Do you have a fireplace
Hahahaha what
A bat somehow got into our apartment
What do we think
Will it be good
I just made a honey and almond butter sandwich on a hotdog bun
Momo can meet and they can play
Bring it to basketball
which to be fair it is
i think he thinks autism is a funny word
What does this mean
getting her a service harness and taking her everywhere this weekend
my neighbor just knocked on my door and asked me to watch her fish over the weekend and ive never felt more important
It seems really fun
They have puppets serve ice cream
Its at color club
Im gonna trick you into being a puppeteer one of these days
they wanted to lock me up and throw a sock on my hand
oh god the place color club kept emailing me about working at
i believe its at Color Club
I got your sugar hole right here
What cross streets
Whats the sugar hole
Aaron Klopfer is that the ice cream you got the other day
Wait have you guys been going to the sugar hole
yeah because they should pay you for the emotional labor of having to deliberate on whether u should tell them
genuinely im like do i have to tell my boss i just soaked a chair HAHAHAH

ghostwriting has its own joys

Aaron Klopfer sorry for not tagging you in my story didnt expect for it to pop off historically
Nice job bro 
Aaron def slammed 
I left my phone at self checkout and just found it
Found this shirt at a thrift store in Arizona

They typically do bachelor parties before wedding as sort of like a one last hooray before their lifestyle dramatically changes
no 
My brothers bachelor party is there this weekend and I have not been given any good reason why
Stfu these are all so hot
did you hear the cat song
did you hear my new about cavities tho
today is slightly worse vibes than yesterday  hope this helps
already posted girl
Idk but theyre all dope
I like  da most but I feel like non comics would like  a lot
I used to be self conscious about overalls but I think it can work
sooooo cute
wear em w a wife beater
overalls are perf outfit
I think n itll be cute for the fall

All bangers

some nice nature stuff around there but its august so I wouldn
phoenix sucks
been to Phoenix several times since my mom moved there a few years ago so I have kind of an interesting answer to this question no
Itd make sense to surface content to an initial percentage of following and only increase that surfacing based on engagement imo
Is it based on a mix of engagement and following now
my girl group chat said that one too
ok lets ride
Yeah I think  shows Coles more than the other two and the other two are great pics that can be used for anything
the sitting at the bar one
Then Im gonna say 
i just think i wanna save the other pics for other promos
Can we do a carousel
its for me i host coles now post
Theyre all great
bathroom is mt fav but i think maybe i should just do the pic at the bar
What is this for
Leaning  but theyre all good
which one
how do
thank u dude
Apparently instagram changed theirs and now everyones reach is fucked
Everyones algorithms are so confusing
Reddit has a system for differentiating genuine engagement so your up votes might not immediately count
I upvoted wth
I fucking dare you bitch they love me on there
We can work it out in the producers chat
could enroll here 
Im going to Phoenix this weekend is there anything cool to do there
Ok epic
Show usually starts like  minutes within that time
""
Bring a court date
When da doors tho
""
Im genuinely sorry you have to deal with him
Gonna bring a date 
What time does agents start typically
hes soooo insane to me hahahaa
We should do this
I do like this idea a lot
Is he gonna mention he needs to get a reserved spot at Coles bc of this
Kristi we have to cancel
FUCK
Ah shoot were all busy on Sunday
Im starting a half hour open mic  person list
Im kind of over this short set crap
I would only go to that if there were at least two comics who were running half hours
heard theres a pretty cool show at AliveOne on Sunday
Love this
Bc then I think we could generate buzz for the show and drama and then start selling a narrative of Johns revenge comeback show
Its my producer goal to slowly accumulate power and gain enough of Johns trust that Im able to kick him off the show
I was just about to say
You should oust John I think thatd be a fun punishment
Im a producer on the show now
Agents of Chaos tonight btw if anyone wants to come hang and watch us abuse each other
climb anythingplaying with string couplet knocked me out
Lets goooooooo that is the best

Fast bike teeth

Level  tooth grindset

They also said that I have ground my front teeth down to levels that you usually dont see until someones late s
They found no cavities and expressed admiration that I had never had a cavity in the past
I didnt get a cleaning for years so I didnt want to include myself but it has just been confirmed
Adding you to the No Cavity chat
Still never had a cavity bitch
Least attractive to whom Definitely not my wife
Magic trick
They did a John segment

Just talked over this speech
Just listened to a  minute speech about sitting my white ass down and listening
Im listening
just listened to a  minute long speech about the power of silence
Oh wait its  lol
I just mean that they close at  pm
You walk in youre like yup
Just a fresh market place
Like no potential association with negative vibes
Really just objectively better
Seems like not getting laid has made him a better writer
Fresh market place was such a better name

They told me they were lying to you
Could do without their owner always yapping about it tho
They dont mind it
Ive talked to them
I think theyre ok with it
I havent drank out of it so I can tell you about quality but my cats appear to be drinking water of mine
Yeah they both need filters they both need to be cleaned
They both seem to need to be cleaned the same amount in my experience

Neon Beecroft Landlordgelion
I think Ive made this riff before but it bears repeating
Me and Eva ended up paying our broken lease landlord Neon Beecroft an extra month of rent like buying him off with a post lease security deposit somehow Very weird
Especially if youre not looking for a roommate and offering a whole apartment
i imagine subletting isnt as hard w fb groups now a days
yeah it feels relatively easy
My experience has always been that theyll like ask you to find a replacement
Usually if you just talk to em you can break it like if you cant pay the rent for some reason theyre always going to prioritize finding someone that can over fucking you over
has anyone ever broken a lease before
Double dare me
Or contestant I dont really know
Winner of Drag Race
Whos that
shes calling me in france
hahahaah
Hahaha
Itd be funny to act like I was just dying from a heat stroke
At the Logan square fuckers market
Trying to think of funny ways to promote
Alternatively I was thinking I might just cover ever inch of a folding table with Agents of Chaos flyers and then cover my body in the same flyers and just kinda stand there looking weird
And I just body slam a couple coffee tables
You bring the coffee table I bring the body slams
Would anyone wanna help me setup a coffeetable body slamming service desk at Logan square farmers market
How was crushes

You gotta question the efficacy of doing something like that
This is kind of on you tbh
Its hard to tell if youre asking or not Personally not something I would go out of my way to do but also not something Im gonna go out of my way to stop
So idk
I think hes just stimming
Is this problematic
Insult to injury
But heres the thing he was using my fucking pair of clippers
And then shaved his own head on stage
I had a dream last night that Klinger shaved off one of my eyebrows
