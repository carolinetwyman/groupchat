Thatâs science baby. I think we have turned it around because the act of sending a first draft unfinished emotionally charged is a universally terrifying experience and I am willing to admit all the errors in my waysâ¦. Interesting how management never ever has to admit when they are wrong. If only there was a better way..

/ sorry that happened to you Maddie:(
happy birthday Matty!
Happy birthday matty!!
All good to know info. It is not going well lol
Happy birthday Mattison!
hahahhahahahah why is there not an undo send optionâ¦ i feel like outlook has or had this
Just for the future
I wish they had that setting in the chess app
Happy birthday Matty!!!
You can change settings to like have an email sit in your outbox for however long before sending
I EXPECT MY EMAIL TO REACH THEIR INBOX THE MICROSECOND I HIT SEND
"They're literally waiting 30s to send it, just in case you decide to back out"
It's so funny how that works
*unsend
Some have a resend option if it was within 30secs or a min
What emailer do u use?
"I committed the cardinal sin of accidentally hitting send instead of draft on a very emotionally-charged, unedited email about scheduling issues to my new general manager. New layer of hell I canât handle"
thank you I am blessed to be in a group of so many capricorns and spoiled by all ur love
Happy birthday Matty!!
Happy beautiful birthday to our dearest Matty
incredible job opportunity for @Joey D Bednarski

What is gay ass
"Chicago coyotes are like cicadas, they come and go in a 17 year long cycle"
you must be in cahoots with the Quiznos Coyote
There never was no coyote and there certainly never was no coyote incident!
No Never
Did anyone else hear about the coyote Quiznos incident
I canât believe I never knew there was a coyote in a Quiznos in 2007
Hahahaha
Huhâ¦needed the captions
It was bizarre
He did great!
Diego was handed the best possible audience he could have ever asked for
"gay ass is also packed audience core, such a good crowd"
that show looks so fun! is sully running that
Got exhausting to watch after a while
Like just justifying every shooting
And he was basically just a shooting apologist lol
I used to watch this dude on YouTube that was a former cop and he would do shooting breakdowns
Copcast!
Itâs very Chicago
"It was me, a musician, am artist who does the posters for the O Sees and a former cop who started a podcast"
That show looks really cool
Actually pulling an audience!
Dude is doing a talk show at a bar in Lincoln square
Huh?
This Welcome to the Show thing is so cool
"His profile says ""Drag Queen"" so it's ok"
Itâs because heâ does musical comedy
And itâs not because every single one of his jokes is homophobic
But I do not like him
Iâve still never seen him
So no one has to follow him
Lmao they put Diego last in the lineup
Or rat race
What about spy kids
I wanna do this one but they wonât let me

No I wish I worked at fabletics
Thatâs good info @horby This is why you should be a bumble consultant

There have been some pretty bad ones telling me Iâll get whatâs coming to me and sexual stuff etc

Just wanna say when they mentioned the Denver Nuggets on chapo the other day that was huge for me
https://www.lincolnlodge.com/ wtf
-a bit
of course
Power of nightmares
Forget the name but super insightful
Also the one where he highlights the similarities between the rise of the Taliban and the neocons is excellent
Ya hyper normalization is crazy good
Also she's been on chapo lol
It was so cool when Sarah canvassed for bernie with Eric Andre ngl
and we talked about hyper normalisation w her lol
one time my ex boy chat put sarah squirm in the chat when you could still do that on twitter
Only Curtis I don't care for is the one who never books me at laugh factory!
Only Curtis I didnât care for so much was the Soviet footage with no narration. Hey Adam ur supposed to tell me how to feel
Anyone trying to brutalist
Is there a move tn
Did you see he made a weyes blood music video lol
"I put it on to get woke, but whatever"
Like heâs such a good editor
trauma zone was sooo good. not to be gay or whatever but as an editor it is really inspiring
Just watched the one about the mall in England
I'm like 35 min into hyper realization but I put it on to fall asleep a lot
I was watching traumazone to fall asleep
okay but if weâre talking mark fisher the realll question is who are the adam curtis heads in the chat ð¤ð¤
Yeah the beauty of capitalist realism is its so short
i like to pair my mark fisher with maggie nelson
thatâs def something to pick up when ur unemployed lol
I wanna read the big anthology of everything that was on k punk but itâs like 1000 pages lol
It's so good
Ive got a library trip coming up and im gonna get this hot book yall are talking about
I just know he propped up verso books for a year with that purchase
"when I worked at cards against humanity the guy who ran it (who ended up getting canceled) ordered hundreds of copies of capitalist realism to give everyone for christmas but he forgot, so there were just like mountains of capitalist realism stacked by the front door for anyone to take lol"
"heâs super good at articulating things in a clear way!! possibly the best, reading his post punk book rn"
thatâs fucking weird behavior iâm sorry
she wonât book claire sundbye on lesbian lodge
like yes
Adult show and tell?
they have this thing against me and theyâve had it since college and wonât book me for mainstage and itâs lowkey bullllllshit
cancelling all these shows and booking ur friends who arenât comedians to do powerpoint nights is not the community forward thinking u think it is
It'd be like a full show not just the record
Million percent
I listened to a podcast on Hauntology and Lost Futures but after reading this I think the book has got to be better. He's explains zizeck so well it's very impressive
Wait I hope you were serious lol
Just group messaged yall on insta! I think they have a form to fill out I have just messaged them in the past
borkey is morally corrupt
wait i have a lot to say about lodge bookings but at work
iâm huge mark fisher girl
yes
Despite being literal gaming history
Oh Because Christian Borkey emailed Guinness and said the PokÃ©mon reading didnât sell enough tickets
That guy was not legit sorry to break bad news
Not officially recognized at sloppies
Yeah it's a lung capacity challenge more than anything else
"Wait Iâm confused, did you not already accomplish this goal at World Record sloppy Sunday"
So im guessing its not PokeRap style cause you gotta go so fast
Yes! Can you connect me
Bruceee you should totally do that at bricktown that would be electric
Oh yeah how could I ever forget
Wait Bruce how were you going to win the Lodge a Guinness world record?
Yeah not worth it
We'd probably have to know a land lord tho to have access to that sort of thing
If only there were some sort of... magical garage event space with some sort of multi functional heating AND cooling unit that could be sort of the new underground diy alt comedy space
Man that sucks Jeff
We can't have you burn down the theater with 3 presale and no Guinness book of world records
Watch them schedule AOC and Chicago method technique at the same time
Sorry @Jeff Braun  I am sorry I know this is old news now but this makes me so mad at Christian Borkey and Lincoln Lodge generic idiocy and overall desire for standup hegemony. Is there another generic standup show that she knows will make them tons of money waiting in the wings? Hilarious to watch the series of emails evolve over the years
I'm literally like I will rent a theater I will buy all the tickets myself
call it the chill as fuck show
Lodge has ignored all my emails about a show that would immortalize them in the Guinness book of world records
What if it was a hit though
You should show them how little you care. Call your show âFuck You Comedy Showâ or something dumb like that
he speed reads 5 newspapers a morning and would quiz us on  them
And I talked to Kerry about it and she was like âbut if you sold out presale it would have been chillâ
"I just remembered that when Sam cut that wire at AOC, Kyle was like âwe canât have you guys burning down the theater with 3 pre-sale ticketsâ"
Also presale is stupid? Just base it on actual sales
They canceled my block party show bc low presales and I tried to reschedule it like 3x and theyâve been ignoring me lol
Iâm sorry! @Jeff Braun  Lodge has been really weird lately about fun shows
I feel like people like him read a bunch of summaries of books
"I was going to say, I didn't know you interned at British community College"
he has the vibe of someone who canât read but probably reads more than all of us combined
i would love to see him write a book
Lmaoooooo
"oh no this is the guy to be clear

 https://youtu.be/A_4qELaY4Q4"
I think stand up is disappointing because most thoughtful art being destroyed is because it passes through so many hands with different agendas
Sorry for being annoying
"I understand the desire to consume things that let you turn your brain off but I wish there was more space for thoughtful art in the modern world - like, across the board music, books, film included"
Going to pour one out for Mark and David Graeber tn
RIP mark Fischer :(
Probably explains why like crowd work comedians (the bad ones) are also becoming more popular
yeah he was really good i liked him
like interrupting me in the middle of speaking to be like âuhmmm uhmmm yeah uhmmm this article was about uhmmmâ but like he had a point
Probably the most succinct and digestible piece of theory I've ever read
and he made fun of how nervous i got when i talked
I just got it today and am ripping through it I think it's excellent
heâs the guy who introduced me to the people in the office as jewish
What was he like?
Oh my god that's so sick
dude i interned for mark fischer in 2012
I think about my brother in law who likes Andrew Schulz and all that stuff and I guess there's some kind of wish fulfillment they get from watching that kind of comedy and maybe things that differ challenge them in a way they dislike? I suppose it's harder to relax when what you're consuming requires attention
"I think the lodge is also maybe only interested in short term and less likely to take chances than it was years ago, havenât they been losing a lot more money in the last few years?"
Or to rephrase why is alt comedy maligned rn even when we've seen it has potential to succeed within the current system
"Yeah I think it probably is, but itâs being diluted"
"But as the audience for comedy as a whole grows larger, you'd imagine the appetite for alt comedy would grow even just as a consequence of the law of large numbers"
And main stream viewers want to see stuff similar to stuff that introduced them into liking âcomedyâ which is largely right leaning unfunny podcasts
Itâs because comedy is becoming more mainstream
Bc I don't think people really like it
There is a proliferation of norm-core stand-up happening and I really can't figure out the cause
So true
Two most successful Lodge cast members of the last like 10 years are Sarah Sherman and Megan Stalter and theyâve created a space that wouldnât be accepting to either of them
Because the people who run these things think less of what they perceive as alt comedy
I feel like a lot of stand-up I see in nyc is homogenized
Idk why comedy as a whole has become so resistant to experimentation
Truly upsetting jokes aside that is annoying
Comedians You Should Know 2
Should have named the show Chicago Hot Dog
"Marry, fuck Tony"
Man this fucking blows sorry @Jeff Braun
What if you changed the name to koll tiny
Beg for one more chance and let me buy every presale ticket for February
Itâs on my list
Chicago method technique that WILL get you LAID
Thatâll catch some eyes
What about the free money Chicago method technique
Have you considered calling it âroast battle?â
"Maybe Hillarious, and a picture of Rodham Clinton in there somewhere"
Christmas we share
"If I find a spade You get custody on fridays, I get saturdays"
"Chicago method technique, hilarious"
Maybe throw a hilarious in the title
I have an awesome projector and am searching for small-medium rooms in spaces that are hungry for alt comedy
It kind of kills the point of a theater of independently produced show if you want everything to basically be branded the same as the laugh factory
The ironic part is the room was packed last night with walk ups and comps
reply with actually friday works for me and my show âOnly Fomedyâ actually
Send him this with dollar signs and question marks
Maybe see what she thinks about this??
âYour art and show name is driving away the kill Tony demographicâ
post this as a promo
So stupid
That kinda art attracts the right crowd for that kinda show
What a little bitch
Oh my god

Did you guys crush open mics this week
No I donât think soâ¦ ð¤¢
yay
Thatâs so true squad
Yes I am feeling better and can eat!!!!
Itâs going around like crazy rn
my intuition says youâre sick
Do you know anyone else that got it?
Probs norovirus
are you feelin better?
I canât tell if I had norovirus this week or go sick from sour gummies from Trader Joeâs
Hi
"My tenant wants me to fix his furnace, but he can wait"
I support you dropping and letting me do your spot
WHAT ATTITUDE IVE GIVEN YOU NOTHING BUT SUPPORT
Look at soon the vultures circle the infirm
Iâm not telling you bc I donât like your attitude
What show is it
Ugh I canât be sick Iâm in the middle of a crisis that only one great 10 minute set can cure
I NEEDED ACCOUNTABILITY
OR BEEN MORE LIKELY
I WOULD HAVE GONE PROBS
SHE SAID SHE WASNT
girl of course she is
WHAT THE HELL
CLAIRE SUNDBYE TOLD ME SHE WASNT GOING TO THE GAZZELLIES
Let him cook without seasoning ð
Need me to fill in?
Feel bad dropping but I canât imagine a show where Iâm more easily replaceable
I can make it
iâm so sad about it iâm doing so many fun shows this week
@everyone white guy spot open at Lincoln lodge
i coughed so much last week that now my vocal cords are really fucked
Dude Iâm actually turning my ass around I keep coughing
have fun at lodge yall- mommy is staying in tonight with a lost voice :((
ð¨no spoilersð¨
Can we please remember not everyone is caught up on traitors
adrienne youâve done such a good job
100 percent agree
Also people underestimate bachelor/bachelorette because they donât realize thatâs also a highly strategic social game
They always think theyâre smarter than they are
"Anyway, big brother players are sub par"
Once Lisa Barlow is on traitors itâs going to win an Emmy
I feel like this was said earlier in chat
and it was
Henry's gotta take a break for that one
I was just stanning my girl dorinda
I knew better
see
Well I didnât know about this
The traitors picked the obvious choice and Carolyn was saying it from the start
The Dorinda choice was a bad one
Ultimate respect âð¼
Dorinda could drink me under the table
I spit
When she was like âohhh theyâre sorry for getting less money just to make us more of a targetâ
THE HOUSEWIVES ARE SOOOOOO DUMB
Dorinda aside
Dorinda ruled
Keep Dorindaâs name out of your mouth
I said âwouldnât it be hilariousâ¦â
Henry told dmed me on the side and asked me to say that
I bet Robyn turns it up if she doesnât get murdered immediately
It's gonna make me question why you left your job at the haberdashery
It's so funny
It's really wild how dumd so many of the housewives are
"Hey brother, if your not cumming in caps"
Tonya is the best anti hero though
Tonka should be in Florida with his family
Bob the Drag Queen is my favorite this season
Yeah I was kidding
wait that was good!
It scared me
I donât know why cumming was in caps
"take away the emphasis, I remove my like"
I love Alan CUMMIMG
He made Tonya give up Tonka!
On Alan cumming?
You're making Joey say slurs
Just give Alan his flowers
Henry there's no point in doubling down
Stolen valor
I think Alan Cumming is getting credit for his outfits that I think the production team is designing
anyways I'm off to the lincoln lodge
Henry's not homophobic he just hates faggots
Ho Mo Phauxbic could be a good drag name
Excited to see her reaction
Gabby might find the smoking gun next episode
Sounding more homophobic by the minute
Yeah homophobes don't make sense!
heres what i love: gabby windey being the literal bachelorette and now not only being a lesbian but also seriously dating a standup comedian. i find her perfect & i hope she wins
Yes
"I donât think thatâs fair, I think bob the drag queen is the best character on the show"
Australia season two was terrible
And yes I HAVE seen the international versions
Alan Cumming is being so cunty and gay and not liking that is homophobic
mitchies there & he made it sound star studded
shut the fuck uppppppo
Is it an electrifying vibe at Godâs Lincoln Lodge tn?
if i made a real life traitors game could we play it at the garage @Johnbo Walter Stockwell
Sexist ass comedy show host forgot the names of the Flintstone's wives smdh
Laugh out loud big
At one breakfast Tom Sandoval has the biggest pit stains Iâve ever seen on tv
From s2
Commenting on the food is canon for traitor behavior
I love their inclusion of him in episode 3 was him just commenting on food lol
I want Ivar to just keep chillin lol
At this point only he could change my mind
I need @Mitchie âs take
Maybe Ian is a traitor? ð¤
It's weird having Ian side with me
Who knows maybe I'll chill and watch The Traitor
I'll bring my glowsticks
"Damn, gonna have to make an appearance it looks like"
"Anyways it sounds like a lot of the chat is in or busy tonight but if anyone was planning on stopping by the dj event later the address is

2625 N Central Park (come around back) and it's byob just fyi"
Spinoff host trying to stand out energy
Cmon
This something or other is iconic
Andrea maybe
You can't call her iconic if you idk her
Yeah but I bet everyone in the uk does
Alan is pushing too hard
You don't even know her name
Idk the UK woman but I can tell sheâs an icon
But you're just plain wrong here unfortunately
I appreciate you sticking up for the below the line hosts of the international seasons
And he was good in spy kids
The Alan cumming role being âiconicâ is erasure for the other international seasons that came before US and I wonât stand for it
And so many people biffed it
They had to run across floating platforms late in the game
And that was redeeming
"Jesus Christ, never come to my workshop again"
Like pure laughter
Season two though he was laughing so hard during one of the challenges
Sorry you're wrong
Wrong
I also think Alan cumming is annoying
i wanna be alan
Chat traitor is anyone telling the Joe Eames chat our secrets
wait yes!!!
Chat should have one big game of traitors
Chat should have traitors
OMG THERES A TRAITOR IN CHAT?????
If I made Rebecca watch every episode of every show WITH ME we'd never watch a damn thing
im a traitor
well john ill have you jnow mitchell left and im still letting it play
Thatâs married couple stuff
You gotta take that step as a couple
I donât co-sign that statement
"See, you gotta drop the requirement of watching together"
Dylan efron is proving to be the cleverest efron
All the traitors in one room strategizing is such bad play
we're only one ep in
The cliffhanger of the third ep is eating me alive
this is zac efron's brother erasure
I bet they do on YouTube
Someone should make a cut that excluded any mention of who is a traitor
I feel like voting him out or murdering him is just a waste of time so he will go far
Too much exposition
Truly the most secure spot as a player
Honestly a great place to be for n
Chrishell from selling sunset has ROASTED him a few times already
"I think heâs taken the role of âtoo dumb to be a traitor, but too unlikeable to strategize withâ"
Itâs awesome that heâs famous
Heâs one of the dumbest people on the planet
I need him to last till the end
Sandoval is the best of us
Sandoval and Britney Spears weird ex
Have to say that the straight white guy delegation did not send their best this season
ð
Just to piss us off maybe
Why hide that from the viewer?
I feel like they would have said that in the rules?
Iâm guessing they werenât allowed to say which number of doors from the left they were
Yo the way they're playing the door game is pissing me off
Tell her to send me pics anytime her dog shits
Give her my number
Did dog eat a burger
It looks like a burger patty
Hahahahahahahaha
my mom sending me pics of my 18 year old dogs diahreaheh
the eyes are so weird looking and the skin is too smooth!
why do they have a weird ai filter on all the confessionals
SHE LOVES TOO HARD
I'm a huge Ayan fan
"The monster is throwing the shoe, not shoe at monster"
"Sort of a reverse al-Zaidi situation, I'm afraid"
"Who is he, Muntadhar al-Zaidi??"
Was it with Kayley Horton
Caroline*
Heâs not even funny
And the faithful really fuck over someone at the end imo
"But also season 2 is kind of bad, the traitors make enormous mistakes"
"She has the street smarts of a career addict, not to be brushed aside"
She gets bullied by the nuero typical
Same thing happened to her in survivor
But sheâs high intelligent
Everyone underestimates Carolyn
I agree
3
3?
Which season
Absolute idiots
Huge mistake
Ok yup it was who I thought
Wait sorry I don't know yet
Need to talk bout dis
First murder was a mistake
Joe Kilgallon cheated on his wife then got really drunk and threw a shoe at lodge and they gave him a gazzelie for it
Just wondering why you didn't change it
Traitors rocks
Need a daily summary
Can I get the short and dirty of it all
The chat going crazy today what is going on
Why are we all harping on this
So itâs like
I already spelled it sow
Iâm trying to teach Andrew to respect women
Ok that's kind of what I thought ty
Kerry covered that with her joke I think
Sorry
Isn't it spelled sew
You guys could hit a couple open mics together or whatever
No I got my lovely gf a sowing machine for Christmas and she is also learning to sow
Klinger my fist will give you a free alteration to your Face if you try to do that
âhit you upâ you mean ask for free alterations ââââ
who are you going to hit up about reaping?
@Matty Merritt Iâm going to hit you up about sowing later
There's no set johnversation volume bc any johnversation will expand to fill up any room or container its confined to
But that's neither here nor there
Not a normal johnversation volume
Which is like a normal conversation volume
"Honestly I've been blasting music in there, and the loudest it gets outside is like 40 decibels"
You can't even tell it's the ac thumping on the roof when it starts spinning up
How sound proof is ur garage
"I got it to heat the garage and wouldn't you know, it's too cold for it to heat the garage!"
look at this puppy
INSTALLING
You're just taking away the crucial part of stand up
Or a monologue or a play
Well they have these it's called a one person show
how did we know this info from the gazelllies do we have someone representing us from the inside
"weâre holding vouch up my ass, hop in!"
I heard the crushes auditions are at laugh factory this year
SORRY LAUGH FACTORY
gonna start a rumor the netflix auditions are happening at crushes
I think so
Not when thereâs real housewives to watch
canât wait to hear about the trip!!
Both of those guys are way more talented and better than Iâll ever be but i just canât get into their comedy at all for that reason
is this the netflix is a joke thing
Jerrod is one of my favorites. The perfect amount of self indulgent
"I think drew michaels and Jerrod Carmichael too self indulgent on stage, but not untalented"
also im post covid comedy
I think it would make better lineups than cysk
"like why would
i know that guy"
well i think the whole thing is im a gen z girl
i feel like i just learned about the concept of absolutely not liking someone and liking their stand up
Make a new cysk called comedians Kristi has heard about
I think I would love his standup if he was like 15 percent less up his own ass
No way to know unfortunately John was fixing his ac
Iâm back in town. Did I win a Gazzellie?
He did a residency at the lodge a couple years ago and I kinda liked him despite all of the bad things Iâve heard
Speaks to his talent that he is successful when it is incredibly rare to meet a comedian that doesnt hate him
Not to be a contrarian drew michael type but i like drew michael's standup
And then they make it and itâs like oh yeah standup looks insane when thereâs no one laughing
Theyâre like why is no one doing this
All Iâm sayin is that someone has the idea to film a standup special w no audience every five years or so
(the joke was about killing myself)
I took Kevin bozemans class in 2013 and he came to give feedback and he liked one of my jokes
6 sorry
Five words for you buddy
@Cameron Gillette has more info
I remember when the HBO one came out he was on You Made it Weird (I was a different guy then) and Pete being so impressed and talking about how good the suicide joke was that it never had a punchline haha
Every story Iâve heard of him is so incredibly mean lmao. Cam is in love with him though
The thoughts do start get weird after a while though he's not wrong
When I moved to New York I told my landlord I was a comedian and she was like âDrew Michael lived here before youâ
I like his Comedy Central half hour quite a bit but I absolutely hate those HBO special so much
He'd hate that someone is asking that so much
Heâs the guy we would be talking about if this groupchat were set in 2018
Maria bamford did it better
Lmao
who drew michael
Lol was this entire special in front of noone?
Kilgallon got into fight with Drew Michael so I actually take back everything I said
God Drew Michael once showed up at wet cash and did like 30 after the booked headliner
https://youtu.be/BIfDSnJtPcg?si=h0_lkITddMuiZOHY
Why?
Also Drew Michael tried to sue them so thats probably why
Danny is a good guy leave him out of this
Haha I can see Dan Kallas' address on the trademark registration
canât wait to go home and watch the hangover with danny tonight
donât show up to CYSK tomorrow
haHAHAHA
Iâm gonna get hammered at lodge tonight and tell people that theyâll never do AoC
"thatâs actually really good 
(she says matter of factly, as if granting you permission on behalf of her gender to entertain your little idea)"
It would piss off Dan kallis so much
Hahahaha that would actually be so funny funny to do this
Tbh I think youâll hate it
Jokers you should know
JYSK AUDITION SHOW AT THE GARAGE FOR AoC????
Crushes audition show???
may the fours be with you ð¤£
Yeahâ¦yeah thatâs sounds about right
Opened with rape jokes
omg what did he say
But outside of that I heard it was a good time
I stg the shit y'all read
And guess what - he said a bunch of evil things and upset everyone
Also - the drama from the gazelles last night was that they had known monster Junior Stopka close it out
Pre-COVID CYSK was unreal
No more AC installs!!!
"I am reliable, I promise I'll get my act together!"
itâs awesome
awesome development at work my coworker broke up with his 13 year relationship and keeps asking to hold my hand
I dream of another show hosting huge auditions like that
Thanks manâ¦I needed this ððð
Pre-covid it was the hottest comedy room I'd ever seen. All the audition shows I did were like doing stand-up on easy mode
Scared the cats
Man this got a big laugh out of me
Itâs amazing
It seems like it was a really cool show!
hahahaahahahahaha
At that point you gotta introduce him as JoeDaComic
"They had a run where they were the coolest show when bar shows were the coolest thing and everything wasnt at 3 clubs, and i like the show because i'm old and sentimental about it, but it's funny when they expect new comics to care when it's as hit or miss as it's been"
and then chris trani was next in the lineup and i gotta say!! absolutely delightful
and then wouldnât really respond back to me
he was mad i didnât know him and asked his last name
he was really rude to me hosting laugh factory
Damn that's rough
Hahahahahaha
yeah we heard!
"Cysk was comically bad when I did it. Everyone ate shit until I went up (and yeah, I cooked)"
"Kristi and Joey, please do this for chrushes but to people at cafe mustache"
So funny to be in your 40s and have three kids and then yell at some 22 year old open micer that they wonât do your bar show
"In which case, uh oh"
Unless people like it here
Nooooooo not currently great show CYSK!!!!
My favorite part of that lodge story is that he walked up to random tables and told the people sitting at them that theyâd never do CYSK
Yeah he's an asshole
He's being a real shit head i would say
He got scary yelling at kayley to shut the fuck up at lodge
"Hey guys, I was away from the chat for a sec, weâre all still fans of my favorite standup Joe Kilgallon right?"
oh shit is that a good book i just found her wild ig
He has wild entitlement
Thatâs what I learned from reading All Fours
Meanwhile itâs almost always ok for a woman to have an affair
Just doing standup comedy alone gives her the right to he cruel to him
He has three kids with his wife who is a nurse
Esp with a kid due at the time Jesus christ
Heâs the piece of shit
No shade to Kayley the guy is a grown ass man and should know better imo
No judgement on her regardless of whatâs happening
probably
"There's an online test called ""is my wife mean enough for me to cheat on her"""
"If not true I feel bad for Kayley, she could just be collateral damage"
They call it the comedy vault because that's where the best scene secrets are stored
It's okay to cheat on your wife but only if she's mean enough
What happens at Zanies Rosemont stays at Zanies Rosemont
But I'm very good at making inferences
And I trust my sources
Someone saw him and his affair partner making out in the burbs
"Or like, I'm reading between the lines of Kayley Horton's stand-up and his podcast"
He wouldnât stop pressing for it
I can always count on you two to ingest all the local content
Iâve heard that itâs been confirmed
"Just got A flashback, when my mom died I told my rabbi I was too sad to do comedy and he kept insisting I host a roast of him"
Yes. It was covered on his and Jonah's podcast real heads know
I just seemed likely
Was cheating on his wife certified gossip?
I heard he was complaining about his wife being mean to him and itâs like - I wonder why!
Good to know I'm having a better time in New York than he is in Chicago lol
But here we are
Never thought I would have more respect for him as a comic than as a man
"Has a daughter, cheats on his wife, gets banned from the Lincoln Lodge trying to speed run getting blacklisted"
Dude the Joe Kilgallon arch this year has been unparalleled
People love awards season!
Iâm looking at the pictures and Iâm like wait why was everyone there
I wasnât there but i had people on the inside
Wait I just noticed the shoe in the picture
Yes
Is that what his award was for?
I for one wouldnât be celebrating getting so drunk at lodge that I threw my shoe at the window two weeks after my wife just gave birth but I guess thatâs just me
this line is a nod to the famous chat crossword
the first verse is about being a landlord
i cannot believe i missed the housewives/traitors chat ð­
Ur crazy gurl ð¤£
i accidentally changed the default reaction and then made it my whole brand ð¯
IS IT GOOD? IS IT BAD?
I DONT KNOW HOW TO TAKE IT
You're driving me nuts with the 100s
Ok this makes a lot of sense
like
literally me

Is Cindy short for Cindra? Or Cinderella?
Also no one expressed interest in Sunday!
The circumstances of my life have changed
More like the Brutalest
I hate how much Joey lies
Yeah!! Gonna figure out the time tonight!
No actually Joey lied heâs watching it right now. (But if you guys go Thursday I wanna come)
Meredith rocks
YOU ARE DISGUSTING
YOU ARE VILE
Hahahahaha that ruled
"The freak out about recording in the sprinter van, which is already being recorded anyways ð"
Keep logan weird âï¸
ohhh my god i just saw some guy eat shit on a lime scooter at the intersection of belden and st louis <3
they were like wuuuut the fuck
i did see them go to milwaukee that was awesome
The salt lake housewives always bring their a game
She also gets Bat Mizvahâd this season
waiiiit chrishell on traitors is awesome too
i love meredith
ok making it a point to catch up this weekend
Yes!
wait r u talking about salt lake
So very excited to see Dorinda
Sheâs been plowing through rh nyc
It was absolutely electric
I watched the end of this episode with Maggie itâs nuts
Tom Sandoval is providing so many laughs on accident this season
Meredith accused one of the girls of bugging her room
Which is the mark of a great season
Been screaming at our tv more than usual
Iâve been loving this season
I would say you don't have to but you really should bc it is really fun
and alienating people who haven't seen it <3333333
i love going to a party and finding someone else talking about a reality show <3333
something to look forward to ð«¶
i have really fallen off salt lake this season
"You donât need any background at all, very fun for  people who arenât even into reality tv"
I love the thrill of watching a weekly reality tv show it still does it for me
i fear i am gonna get into traitors this season too maddie
also gabby windy!!!!
"Wow Tom Sandoval and Dorinda and a random old Mountbatten ass royal on the traitors apparently, is it the kind of thing where you need to have watched before to appreciate it"
I think Joey is going Tuesday and Lucia and I talked about going Thursday!
They are a different breed
Thats true
The average American mind cannot handle meeting a real housewife in person
I didnât like having the civilians in the American traitors because they were just way too trusting
The British version does civilians which i do think is more compelling but less entertaining in a way
This one has a lot of fun survivor players too
"I know @Adrienne Stout is into it, lots of housewives"
Absolutely love that show
Gibbs start tonight
Havent seen the new season but as someone who doesn't care for reality tv too much this is as good as it gets for me
Ya it's basically just mafia but everyone is like a v good reality tv person
Wait this is like if Among Us was a TV show?????
I do still have a ticket for Sunday afternoon if you or anyone wants
I actually had to switch to today. Itâs intermission rn
"Is anyone watching the traitors, new season just premiered it rules"
"Is it just me, or is Cindy kind of..... BAD?"
cindy you are BAD
I joined a beginning sewing group on fb and its so awesome
I'm djing
Twyman core
Is there a move tonight ?
cite the property taxes in logan square
Counter sue your dad
you canât let him know. just tell color club not to budge. have your dad start litigation
itâs very sweet but now i have to tell him i just donât want him to see my set hahaha
Is there a Sunday viewing or the brutalist happening?
we have the same dad
i did not get purple for the right reasons but it worked out
"Connections

my dad really wants to go but i think he would stress me out so i said i couldnât add to the list
iâm opening for maggie winters tomorrow!!
make a wish everyone
"But doctor, I am poop fucker"
GET A HOME!
Sorry ð
No ð
John do you have to yell in the morning
It'd be so funny if I go through all this and my garage just burns down
I'm messing with propane heaters still
it's effective heating range is like 32Â° to 60Â°
IM SO ANNOYED
THE MINI SPLIT DOESNT HEAT VERY WELL IN VERY COLD TEMPERATURES
Think of how many high powered business deals can happen in that span of time
Thatâs ten New York minutes though
Yet some people can't be bothered to pay the fare smh
"Itâs crazy, like maybe a train will be 10 minutes late, but thatâs it and people just lose it haha"
Yeah dude the MTA runs like a machine. People in New York were always shocked when I would be like âyou have no idea how great this isâ
People in nyc love to complain about the trains and its like lol you mfers have never waited 30 min for the western blue line in the dead of winter
I'm seeing him at schubas in the wild for the first time ever
Weren't him and zako like fighting or something
What was the drama with Greg bartusiak a while ago?
I thought someone recited Ianâs poop fucker joke too close to a dry tree and the joke was too fire
Damn that was the last gazellies too
I'm gonna do this I think
At least you supported them financially
You can have a best tenant award
Hahahahahahahaha
IM SO SORRY
You gotta host the johnzellies in the garage
I was counting on you to livestream them!!!
I'm going to schubas
I WAS INSTALLING MY AC
FUUUUUCK
Hahahahahahahaha
I missed them
Hahahahahahaha wait the Gazellies are definitely over
I think it's maybe just a good reflection of the effects of prolonged lack of investment of resources in infrastructure and public goods combined with climate change stuff
Lol I'm running late
I want Gazellies updates
I donât personally understand how there are so many different separate fires at the same time in separate spots.. like are they all connected? or if it is that easy of phenomenon right now due to the Santa Ana wings so it is truly happening everywhere with big vegetation
My brother said the same thing that they think the winds were strong enough to blow transformer and spread the spark. Also there had been two years of wet winters creating an abundance of growth that was all super dry at this point from 8 month drought. Transformers blew in my brothers area so they are still without power but no fire
Wait until theyâre over and then pop off I think
It is funny but maybe
Yeah my brother lives in North Hollywood and says the winds are insane. I think at some point the air gets so hot that any existing fire spreads super easily
"makes sense, itâs so so scary"
But I'm assuming events like that are springing up all over and the winds are just spreading to too fast
Is it insensitive to make a video where I show how tired I am after sucking all the LA firefighters dicks
And oxygenating them
And the wind has been blowing the fire to a ton of other places
And the sparks caused a fire bc everything is so dry
A friend who lives in Santa monica said winds ripped part of a roof off a building and hit a transformer or something
I think in some places up to 100mph
And there have been lots of winds gusting all over
Not sure of the exact cause but it is so unbelievably dry out there
is it like wind and heat combo
ok my dumb question is iâm confused how the fires are starting
"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW
Washington, DC 20500"
667 evergreen ave brooklyn 11207
"Plz drop addresses for Christmas card, I finally got them @everyone"
can i ask a dumb question
I do a bit with that sorta tho
Itâs called having a refined chat voice
I literally havenât once
THE GAZELLIES!
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT!
nevermind you haven't I checked
lmao I feel like you've said that joke in this chat like 3 times
Read the whole chat to my therapist and he said itâs our moms fault
"I just downloaded an app I saw an ad for on tiktok, and it's like a tiktok clone, but it's only comprised of clips of this one movie lmao"

I refuse to do any crossword that isnât at least a 15x15 grid
yeah iâm done i got 4
I don't think I want to keep trying this even as a bit
17 across is preworkout
18 across is really brilliant
and did you know septic tank doesnât end in an e
do you spell it electriciy
john have you ever heard the word electricity
it's so funny
I'm actually laughing so hard at this crossword

It is another simple machine though

"Think ""literal crap"""

Anything I should bring up in therapy in a few mins
just realize red means wrong so weâre doing really good
Might as well be a guess the answer puzzle
I hate these crosswords where each word only overlaps with one or two others
Explain your thesis behind this you absolute nimrod
I'd like to see some of you rentoids come up with a better crossword puzzle
explain that
How so?
Electrical doesn't even make sense for some of the clues it's the answer for
alright alright sorry!
im actually doing it rn
HOW IS LANDLORD WAGES NOT OBVIOUS???
i dont need any hints
"3 of the answers are ""electrical"""
Here's a hint
this is too easy iâm insulted
2 across is fork
I think you would have to experience years of concussions to make sense of John's clues
completely impenetrable
thereâs nothing wrong with thinking a lot and itâs okay no matter what society tells u
I've thought about it a lot and I have a couple problems with it still but I overall really liked it

and so joey is sort of the no nonsense brass tacks sort of fellow while john is always making random additions to the property and mucking things up with his goofiest newest invention
well john could pay joey minimum wage he needs to pay rent and stuff but john could still turn a profit while doing less work
Could make money on that I assume?
id watch that

I did see a maybe stupid LinkedIn hack so that you can see jobs that were posted like 30 minutes ago so you can apply early. Idk if that is helpful at all!!
God bless you
I can't believe you didn't quit the day after trump got elected and your boss was singing three little birds to the whole office
I sincerely wish they had just fired me
I'm sorry Joey
I cuss out the very nature of this company once a day and that's with a very minimal workload
I'm not about to start working hard for this company
my manager quit at Same Day
Did this happen at same day?
Why does this keep happening to you
he has seniority over me and they just kind of expect me to take on all the work load. Mr Hanley will learn to regret which of the customer service fellas they fired
they're firing my coworker tomorrow which is such bullshit that I won't be coming into the office again and am looking for a new job asap

can I ask why this is cool though

"I look for groups of things that really to each other and then pretty quickly realize that there is usually another thing that could fit into that group so then I stash that for later and look for a different group and when I confidently have two clear groups, I make the first guess, etc"

I don't get why people fell for it. Sam is too cool to do something lame like that

goodreads is the only platform where i can see one of my exes rate toni morrison books 3 out of 5 stars. awesome website!
i famously do goodreads
I do Goodreads. I think the layout of bookworm is a lil goofy
Iâm using bookworm and the only thing I donât like about it is the other users
Okay I'll just keep what I'm reading to myself then lol
That being said who cares
Goodreads is not a useable app and is owned by Amazon
I should try to be a Hasan Piker Type
And just debate anyone who voted for Donald Trump
U should start a Tiktok debate page
So ur saying I should join?
A lot of misinformation and racism
Bookworm seems like the x of book websites
Should I join goodreads or bookworm?
Can someone lemme in

"It was a good movie, entirely without self reflection"
That never happened
I liked the part where he said itâs ânosferstu timeâ hefore doing cool stuff
They remembered how to make movies
Nosferatu was sick
Free Ukraine
"Honestly agree, that whole conflict pisses me off"
Just overheard someone in a coffee shop in Brooklyn say we  weren't aggressive enough against Russia during the Ukraine conflict lmao
they made us all introduce ourselves like we were in mickey mouse club house as the intro it was so bad
i think my coworker is mad at me
i made every scene about drinking and driving
Then someone said it was because the generator died and nobody could leave the theater and we walked out

"Nosferatus warning, sailors in mourning"
"Nosferatus delight, sailors at night"
but I genuinely don't think any one of us could have come up with something as funny as Nosferatu's Delight
ok look I hate AI
@Meta AI imagine I took 1/3 of an edible for nosferatu but I looked at the box and it says this is the kind of weed that makes movies real

Gonna need updates on this in a major way

Iâve been doing more improv again and I love it
This is healing
Chat is really reaching across the aisle here
Itâs fun to do standup tbh
never meet your heroes
Also so fun to do standup at improv shows
Whatâs the moral
my brother took an improv class at u chicago and two girls were paired in a scene where one wound up peeing in a bucket. like the teacher had to stop her and say âdonât actually pee in the bucketâ and the girl responded âbut i want to.â and then the two girls in the scene fell in love in real life.
to do not watch
improv is so fun
and now itâs tonight
and i was like yeah!
i feel crazy my coworker is an improviser and asked me at work to do her improv show

There are a few things that frustrated me but I still enjoyed
iâm so frustrated that he went back in the game
I just finished it
We should have had a substance chat
If anyone wants my contrarian takes on squid game or the substance dm me separately
I hated season 1 tbh
anyone else watching. squid game season 2
but schubas is on
making soup rn gonna watch sex lives of college girls
Also valid!
itâs a mental illness def but not one iâm willing to dissect
"Good move I think, no need to do a show while sick, it never ends up being worth it really"
i literally canât make my brain think iâm not banned from a show when i drop
i did drop tightship iâm definitely sick
Yeah she actually made me make that post in photoshop and pass it around different group chats
"Youâll never get on tight ship again, even if youâve been on multiple times and they for sure asked you"
suz just told me they posted that as a marketing scheme
wait so like i heard that schubas is on
can someone go to schubas and check?
Yeah itâs embarrassing to go
Hmmm  I think there is no Schubas tonight
I canât be seen there itâs social suicide
Careers will be made and dreams will be shattered
It's the event of the year
You gotta go
I donât know if I can go but I would get tacos with people across the street at antique taco
Iâm avail
Dammit
Next Thursday
When is it?
It's at a den of something
Hopefully Bad Comedy wins best podcast so I can see mack Nepper give a speech
John if youâre going I think Iâll go
might pass
as much as I love celebrating dead eyed straight guys who make comedy their whole personality despite not seeming to enjoy it much
I think thereâs a half off promo
I'm sure I could probably get in free but I want them to keep doing it
jfc
A nice lil $20
Yup!
is it at the Den again?
Alright I'm buying my tickets
And he's just ranting
They brought out someone that's just the CEO that got murdered lol
It's really rough lmao
And it's making me think of the Gazellies
I'm just watching the roast of 2024 on Netflix
as a family
we could January 6 the Gazellies
I kinda wanna be there for the drama
"The gazellies are January 9th, anybody wanna go?"
will i die if i donât go to tightship tn
but my throat hurts xD
i hate dropping shows
u know what i already know the answer actually NVM poll cancelled
i feel like kinda sick but not dying
quick poll
I am staying in and practicing the future kazoo
@Joey D Bednarski this would be a great night for you to learn the flute part to mask off
You look tired
Cute baby!

Anybody going 2 Schubas tonight
Are you working that night
I could do that
9:30 or after maybe
Wut time
Does anyone want to go see nosferatu on Friday evening
I volunteer my mouth for #3 ð
I also gotta think about social media and such
"I do want to hear your thoughts, but it might be a little while before I put them into action. It might make more sense to hold off until I'm in a place to put them into action. First and foremost my focus is just getting baseline operational stuff finished. 
1. Seating, need 40 folding chairs 
2. Heating, need a heating source that won't potentially suffocate audiences (probably gonna get a minisplit)
3. Shitting, gonna set up a piss hole or something"
@Aaron Klinger @Johnbo Walter Stockwell I have gone down the qlab wormhole and am fascinated with light cues
I've had it it's good
"It would be fun, Iâll come over and weâll look at everything then figure out best budget solutions"
Would like an Ian take and review
I heard their vanilla ice cream is stupid good
"Sure! I have a pretty simple setup right now that only allows for me to turn the stage lights on and off. And it's a combination of track lights that I use for fill, and two spot lights"
@Johnbo Walter Stockwell could I help lighting design your venue
Iâm killing an hour in jc licht with a baby
that would be funny too
hahaha probably a small one
Can you fit a uhaul
"But I also want to do that as a punishment for agents of chaos, where I'm like, ""I'm gonna go park my car"", and then the garage door opens"
Rebecca wants me to do a thing where I do a set on the car and then she drives it out of the garage
hahaha
What if your first show is a roast battle between this chat and Joe eames chat
It would be so funny to have them come to the first show
HAHAHAHAHAHA

John is your garage classed as an entertainment venue
"if something isn't up to code, or seems fishy, you can tell the city about it and get an inspector to come by!"
you do have the power to report your landlord's code violations!
To fill out a form that would increase their property taxes
To threaten landlords
By renters
Is an under used incredible tool
What this is
it's lit
and ask them questions about this shit
I found out I can just do the property tax appeal through them
"Also, I pay like $7 a month for a benefit with my work that basically gives me legal representation for free"
these fuckers have no idea what they're dealing with
I'm a prophet

"Some of them are listed as having an unfinished basement, and then simultaneously have a basement apartment listed on like apartments.com"
ur single handedly taking down fishman i like it
"And it's not like, these are some down on their luck elderly people who aren't making good money anymore. These are all multi-unit buildings, without senior-exclusions, that aren't listed as having a garage or a finished basement, when all of them do"
not all of it but some obvi
$12 a month??? thats my BEER money
these people have too much money on their hands
"thats actually good can u get some of my neighbors on the other side of kimball, i just got strong armed into signing up for composting"
"fuck you, you're gonna be a good neighbor"
"Honestly, exactly"
"in a way, you're forcing community"
"So I'm basically paying more than some of my neighbors, when, by all appearances, they should really be paying much more."
"Yes, exactly"
oh and like others pay more
"So, if a property is assessed at a lower value than another property, they pay less in taxes"
"Every township in chicago is basically given a chunk of the city budget that their taxes are responsible for paying. Each individual property in that township is then assessed at a specific value to determine the individual amount for which that property is ""responsible to pay"" which is their ""property tax"""
i just genuinely am curious
no shade
like narcing on ur neighbors
wait but actually what do you get out of it haha
it's absurd
They just get to pay less in taxes
"if they don't report to the system that they've added a garage, or finished the basement, there's no repercussions"
Heâs literally raising the rents on other landlords
and it relies on property owners self reporting when there are changes in the characteristics of the properties
Heâs a landlords landlord
"Like, they use an automated data model to estimate the value of all the properties"
"In all genuineness, it's kindof bullshit how the property tax system is setup"
Just when we thought you couldnât get any more likeable
blood will flow in the streets
I'm declaring war on Logan Square
"Currently working on finding out how to submit ""property characteristic errors"" to the assessors office so my neighbors pay more in taxes"

NOPE ðââï¸
It doesnât make sense in other venues
Can I do a bit where I kill myself by leaving the car running with a garden hose
I HAVE VACUUMED UP ANY AND ALL DUST. IT DOES NOT EXIST IN THIS SPACE.
My only thought is maybe did we consider the dust
The brick wall looks great
I did some estimating and it seats about 40
"Garage is pretty much good to go, baby!"
My shift was lowkey not goated
til theyâre done
i guess donât tell people the ideas u care about
like its def been done before but yeah it feels too close to home and weird timing
of someone else to do it first
yeah thatâs a unique idea and definitely not cool
That sucks tho I'm sorry
Sounds like she just had some smoke and mirrors deflection move
i like did in a way!!! yeah idk i feel weird and annoyed
itâs like too late now but normal to be seething
oh yeah i think u should have said something then
and i was like hey! and she said that weird thing about how itâs different
like 2 weeks ago
idk i guess drag queens are just used to stealing ideas tho lol
when did you find out?
i feel like itâs tooo late?? like sheâs doing it tonight and probs rented the uhaul already
like why not
i think u should actually tell her itâs not cool with you
this is worse than immediately after i started comedy every single comedian started joking about dating
Jk not drama just undeniable inspiration I feel like? But also anything goes I spose
truthfully iâm gonna be a bit annoyed bc i feel like im gonna see like 10000 insta stories being like âneutral gena is a geniusâ
Thatâs like real housewives style comedienne drama
I think thatâs pretty crazy
and i was like ????
and she was like no what iâm doing is marketing what ur doing is art
Roadkill presents: labyrinth
she like told me in the office sheâs doing it and i was like woah whereâd u get that idea
iâm having a headliner in westys
Or see if u can find a place with a bunch of storage lockers and set up diff comics in them
You should drive the you haul to a storage locker and have the headliner in there
i was like gonna film my special in summer and have her open for me
I had an idea recently for road kill
anyway you all are invited to my show in a the moving guys truck
Yeah that's a little too close to home if u ask me
i would ask her
idk iâm not the first one to do a show in a uhaul
i mean iâve had the roadkill idea for like two years almost at this point and have been talking to her about it forever
itâs like theyâre doing a grand entrance in a uhaul
Id feel weird!! Is the show happening in the uhaul and have they ever talked about it before
i donât own the idea but i guess sheâs like going around the office saying she thought of it before me????
should i feel weird that netural gena is like renting a uhaul for her show tn at boots
thatâs a really good one
more road head and go worldwide
what are you guys putting down can i copy of you?
what should my new yearâs resolution be

Genas general? The hospital?
Iâm going to Genaâs for real. Starts at 9
Gonna make a steak dinner and clean I guess
I googled hospital Logan square lol
It sounds like a Logan square pop up
Itâs a bit! I am not going to the hospital
Is this a bit or a real place
Ok epic
Hangs
I think all the couples in here are doing small solo hands
A big group of us are hitting up The Hospital. Probably getting there around 9 pm

Feeling good ð
Got my rental laptop returned to Costco
Damn everyone's getting punched on the bus except me :(
I deserved it though I was on my way to Second City
some kids did that to me on the bus a couple years ago
you didn't give me time to guess?
Throat bite
solves the whole thing
weâve just gotta get that kid who bit andrew to bite this guy
Meet cute!
We're finding that guy
When I come to New York

LET THE BLOOD FLOW ðª
The fear kicks in
"When you immediately resort to wrenching their balls off and biting their stomach, it's over"
"See, so many people assume you're fighting on fair playing field"
Are you kidding me
I will HAPPILY bite another man
thatâs how you reeeeaaallly get em
Itâs all about biting
"But I was sitting down too, pretty stuck"
"Hmm, I'd think twice maybe"
Iâd say at least
Or bigger
Was he John sized?
I'd kick a dude in the face like a horse
"I was facing forward in a seat and he came from behind, I didnât know it was happening or else I would have! But he was huge, Iâm not fucking around with that"
Like a fucking donkey
I'd start kicking so fast
"Honestly so many people feel obligated to use their hands in a fight, but buddy, on a bus, your hands are for elevated your legs to kick people in the face"
"Let me be the first to say, happy new year"
Hahahahahaha
I was listening to ABBA
"No, he got off and when I left I went to the bus driver and was like âI donât know if this matters, but a guy punched me. Ok have a good dayâ"
Hahahaha imagining you on the phone on the bus just immediately after getting punched calling the cops and explaining the situation while making eye contact is really funny
Did you call the cops or anything?
Hahahahaha
"And you know what? Selfishly, I wish he stayed in!"
He was big and just got out of jail (which he yelled)
Gotta be the bus alpha
Bus Beta
It would be funny if you and me went clubbing
And can I say? Cheugy!
Some guy starting yelling about someone touching women and I was in a single seat with no one in front of me and then he punched me
Me!!
"Guys, guess who got punched in the back of the head on the bus yesterday?"
"gang, we gotta rally"
OH FUCK
"Bad news, I just got a test result back from the doctor and SHE said if I dont have a legendary hang with my friends tonight I'm going to die. What do we do?"

when iâm crying at work the last thing i want is someone to ask me if im ok personally
"I remember I came home once in college to my female roommate crying on the balcony by the front door, said ""hey"", made eye contact, and just kind of awkwardly was like ""oh...."" And continued inside hahahahaha"
it totally depends on if you know them
No like decor

Ty
This and the Bob Keen comment that Caroline posted are really the main highlights
"all the comments are ""i have also been told to quit"" or ""who sent this"""
Also jumping into say Mike brought me to a Wisconsin gig to bully me lol
Through fb
Working canât scroll
Am I missing anything from today
Can you guys send screenshots of everything
Which was an incredible run
The year Bob turned 40 he got punched in the face twice
gena does for sure!
Somebody's gotta have the pic of the blood
He had like eight drinks went outside and faceplanted
*what did the sidewalk do to him?
What did he do to the sidewalk?
And the sidewalk outside Lincoln lodge
Looking forward to seeing this develop
So far I know Bob Keenâs personal axis of evil includes Mike OâKeefe and the Coleâs managers
"i wish i dated more creeps when i was 25, could have been so awesome"
Now he seems awesome
without a doubt
He wants to be the guy to date 25 year olds
Honestly thatâs probably why OâKeefe sent that message
i hate that
TJ has been nothing but nice to me personally but every time Iâve had a conversation with him - he opens with âso Iâm dating a couple of 25 year oldsâ
Bob keen going there!
the algorithm is aware
lmao
that being said TJ has been on are we dating the same guy in a major way
I've barely interacted with him but heard a half dozen stories about him assaulting someone
i wasnât really around for the okeeefe era but it seemed crazy
Many such cases
Just bottled up resentment over not reaching the heights you have known you were destined for since you were 22 or whatever
It will only fuel the fire of the bad open micer
But he wasnât wrong about his act
Especially if youâre Mike O Keefe
Iâm against sending that type of message to anyone out of principle
Whereas Mike sees himself as a true journeyman of the craft and TJ as an interloper hence the rage
Heâs terrible
Wait who sent the text
Iâve only been universally praised for my comedy which is why I do it so infrequently
guys this happens to everyone right?????????
his online behavior is odd
guys... right?
I think he's probably fine but moreso knows a lot of people and gets them to go to his shows
its a badge of honor
"happened to me after every show, its part of the evolution"
we should all post our screenshots of bookers who told us to quit in solidarity
Like was Mike right to send that to him lol
We talked a bit about this yesterday but I am curious if TJ is any good at comedy
this is awesome
like i can never tell if the person im talking to is on the subway or in a library
i kind of hate the noise cancelling feature on apple stuff
I hope we can replicate the lodge experience!

Hahahahahahaha
didn't mean to change name sry pinned a message.
didn't mean to change name sry unpinned a message.
"My hope was to refinance this year, but now that Trump is in office long term interest rates are going up"
"I'm not gonna increase rent this year, but like fuuuuuuck"
But the bank increased my mortgage soon after that by about $500 which put me in an even less comfortable position
I had to increase them when I bought the property so they'd actually cover a reasonable amount of the mortgage. And even then we were paying a bunch on top to make the mortgage.
But it would put me in a position where I definitely wouldn't need to increase them for a long while
"Yeah, totally not saying rents would necessarily decrease"
"I have this print setup that makes a lot of imperfections in the gobo I'm projecting on the wall, and it looks super sick"
Look at how sick this gobo looks that I made to project onto the garage
Yeah landlords are always getting tax breaks and passing that on to their renters
I be paying less in property taxes so I can charge less in rent

say theyâre just trying to get more money out of you! everyone will gasp
"I'm requesting an in-person hearing, I'm gonna go hard"
I can't help but feel like this location specifically is a political thing.
show them this
"There's one property near me that is worth like 1.1M (that one that sold in 2014), and it's been assessed at 660K"
"I'm like feeling motivated to gather more broad data on this, like this is pissing me off so much"
iâll clear this up
cc me
itâs based on value
yeah you should be right actuallyâ itâs not based on sale price in illinois
I'm paying 96% in taxes
"And that's the other thing, a property that sold a month before mine is paying 87% in taxes based on its sale price"
I shouldn't be penalized for buying a property in the area more recently than a bunch of other people in the area
"They're assessing the values of all these properties at 80% of the value of my own home, when the assessed value on public real-estate listings are all between 95%-110% the value of mine"
yeah that sucks. idk i unfortunately have heard the sale price holds a lot of weight with these things but im no expert
I wouldn't have an issue with it if they didn't also assess the value of all the properties in the area
"Sure, and that's a fair way to assess a property's value!"
i think what theyâre saying is itâs based on the sale price. which idk if thatâs true or not but that sounds like what theyâre saying
"just like public documentation showing what it looks like inside, etc"
Or similar
But they all either have public rental listings
"None of these comparable properties have been sold in the past 30 years, except 1 that sold a month before mine, and 1 that sold in 2014"
"They have a tool that you can actually really easily find comparable properties to your own. And it's based on proximity, age, size, and classification. So like, comparable would be basically any property within a certain distance with very similar characteristics."
like when you say comparable you mean they sold for a similar price?
comparable as in their recent selling price?
That's how this works!
Or I should be paying less!
"OK, so, if that's the case, all of these other places should be paying more!"
"I gave the property tax appeals office this very thorough property tax appeal, that cites multiple comparable properties that are all paying about 80% of the property taxes I'm paying. And they denied my appeal by saying, ""yeah, but your property sold for this amount recently"""
wait what happened
This property assessment thing is really pissing me off.

iâm not crazy right thatâs not crossing the line thatâs just likeâ¦. funny?
and the room got really tense
i think i pissed off the green room bc i mentioned that the mosh pit was skipping instead of moshing

Let's say triple crown at 1 for 10 beautiful healthy boys unless anyone backs out and then we go to Anthonys food court cafeteria as backup
I think someone expressing a preference moved the needle in an incredible way
I want triple crown too
How would that move the needle
QXY rules though if the boys want soup dumplings and phenomenal service
What if I said I want triple crown
"I'm feeling kind of sick right now, probably not gonna make it to lunch brunch"
Maddie your contributions are always incredibly insightful and always appreciated
"QXY is not big round lazy Susan style tables itâs two tops and four top style but I have seen them pushed together to make six never 10, thatâs my contribution to the boys brunch"
Some of Timâs closest friends think that he is other bald Logan square dudes in a public setting
That's actually where I draw the line
can i say that
but so many bald guys in logan look alike
weâve met like multiple times
i feel so bad i keep forgetting phylzzzz sound guy
I've also never been so idk sorry :(
Would they be able to seat 10 boys
Ya never been

I'm good with anything
Haven't done the dumplings place yet
I'm also down for triple crown
Oh like the food hall/court? I'd be down to check that out

There's like a cafeteria style place that might be cool

I have done incredible amounts of mental damage to myself by listening to these
https://youtu.be/v9oMcW0i6T8?si=GH4HLrqW5saFzZiA
I understood you but wasnât about to help you in this act of self harm
Roast Battle also has a podcast
i feel like u were the only one who understood me in these four minutes
thank u mitchell
He has interviewed over 150 Chicago comedians and most of them will probably be people you hate
This is Mitchâs speciality
https://youtu.be/v-268Op4_dM?si=uUB2sZHLZq2GhmsN
Most of it is behind a paywall now
I have all his episodes downloaded if you want any John

Proud of you girl you should do The Alchemist next
a lot of people dont know theyre intelligent

My all time favorite moment from a Chicago comedy podcast is when he asked Michael Cooper âwhen did you realize you were so intelligentâ
"Sorry, just keeping folks abreast"

And I listened to Aaron chases podcast where he interviewed Mar McFly and he made up some story about how he had a threesome with two lesbians on a beach"
"the lady who used to cut my hair said she went on a date with a comedian and when i asked who she said ""mar mcfly"""

collin is so funny bc he starts every story off with âso i took a little shrooms nothing too crazyâ
lmfao
collin unger told me he was on too many shrooms to defend her but watched it happen hahaahahah
His name isnât really Mar McFly right
He so good at it
Mitch appearing out of the woodworks to shut in bad comics is my favorite thing
never met him but i know he was shitty to victoria
One time he tried to roast me after the roast show and I said âyou have to say hello firstâ and he got weird
hahahahahaha
Mar McFly should only be posting things like âremember when standup was just bombing for five minutesâ
bunch of g's
and he can't figure out how to stop it
"rebecca's dad is complaining to me that when he shares something to himself, he gets two separate texts"
mar mcfly is such dogshit

My dad sent a super ominous message to my family group chat that he âwants everybody at the house by 4 pm tomorrow to talk about some family stuff before people come over for the party.â
Is so funny
Anne Clank
This is what I'm the New Yorker needs to write an article on
"When I walked into Skibidiâs apartment, I was shocked at how neat it was. Tasteful art on the wall, including an original Rothko. We sat down and he spoke eloquently about the importance of the comfort of his home, and why he thinks spending money on art is worth it. 

âSkibidi dop dop dop yes yes,â he said with a little smirk. Then he added âSkibidi taupled dip deip.â We both got emotional."
Fuck
Lol
KIDDING

It was a Christmas special even that you seriously do not want to miss
"There were thrills, q few twists and turns, and even a couple special guests made an appearance"

Ok apparently I was messing with folks associated with the yakuza
We're still in the investigation phase of this tho
Idk maybe around 830 or 9ish.
What time? That place always makes me feel overstimulated but maybe Iâll wear over ear headphones like a baby who shouldnât be at a concert
@Ian Erickson i am on board for this type of evening
I think me and Kari are investigating the possibility of a Logan arcade sort of evening
Im always trying to get him to come to chicago and do shows but it seems chicago has come to him which is so beautiful

Eric Sony and Hypnosis set the nickname for Andrew Shankland to Mr. Android.
I have something then
today
due to the meeting
so if i donât respond donât take it personally on account of iâm just busy
just a heads up everyone today iâm gonna be super busy cause i have a meeting at 1-1:30 and am gonna be thinking about it before and reflecting on it after
i always read it as short for twink
Kids at school are calling me mr. Android because of my busted ass phone
Gonna start saying this to my cat
Chicago sky player kamilla Cardoso is playing in China and this is a quote from her coach lol
Itâs also the title of a Beatles song!
which is likeâ¦ so donât come to school tomorrow vibes???
and itâs âtomorrow never knowsâ
but then i looked up what tnk stood for
just got asked to open for parkerâs show at the TNK fest
Sargon of Akkad
There's only one TRUE king of the world
WTF
Nobodys here except Kristi
You wonât believe how sober everyone was
Yall will never believe how great it went
IM GONNA SHOW OFF MY NEW POLO SHIRT
sure why not
Me and Rebecca exchanged Christmas gifts
SHOULD I COME TO COLES STIL
Sounds like you just got a condo on Live Your Life Boulevard
iâm like what the hell
he just bought me another one
awesome vibes here on kms ave
rovaughn hill just stole my vodka soda
On the corner of KMS avenue and the boulevard of broken dreams
Iâm gonna go to Coles around 9:30 and have the best set of my life
wow this set at lf just made me go on kms ave
Who goin Coleâs
Iâll be there running around like a gopher for the social media team lol
It was a funny joke that would've aged just really perfectly but I wasn't sure if this was a situation where maybe you weren't wanting that sort of joke so I decided I'll just keep it to myself
Pinball sounds cool!
Where?
I can't I'm going to a pinball convention that day
Why you delete
Anyone want to go to a Chicago wolves game on Jan 4?
Itâs mono red aggro
Might delete it
Anyone want me to do this for their linkdn
Gonna keep it
Hmmmmm
Unless the dating meta has shifted
Might come off as a little too strong
I'd say maybe
Hard to say
Is this too much for hinge
"True, but if itâs bad at the start, usually stays hard"
I feel like I usually see them the other way
That was what made me think it was kind of noteworthy tbh
Itâs not supposed to be like that
Sometimes stuff like this is all about perspective
"Not so crazy now, huh"
Took a live by mistake leave me alone
But there is a car fully upside down in front of scofflaw
No I had to take the picture on the sky and I thought it turned out
Ah shit
thatâs what i was gonna say girl
"bisexual movie star voted for ""No"" in the poll."
"SpongeBob, father of one voted for ""No"" in the poll."
bruh ððð
Andrew I'll just say this:
"Jeff voted for ""No"" in the poll."
Leaving it up so I can learn to sit my ass down and listen
Donât like that riff
On the red pill network
I'll be back in chicago next weekend
Only if it's a podcast
I have been working out some ideas
Lmk if you wanna talk about women as a whole one of these days on a google video hang
"Yeah, like I feel like communication is actually one of the difficult parts of a relationship that isn't good after 4 dates and takes work but w/e"
also early breakups suck bc i feel like nobody knows how to say âhey just not feeling itâ
And add each other on Linkdn
All you gotta say is itâs not the right connection
After four dates
Citing specifics for why something isnât working is a red flag
"the lil beekeeper's son voted for ""No"" in the poll."
"A Brooklyn heartache is required within the first few months, you juuuuust squeaked it in!"
Yeah see I thought this was a thing we had going for us lol
also this is a bad time to announce iâm gonna go no sugar diet in january and id love to have a great dinner with everyone before the year is over!
"but overall andrew u donât want someone whoâs just picking u apart instead of working with you, seems like they have some communicating to do themselves"
"It's super weird being a people pleaser with a person who is sending mixed messages like that, makes you feel a lil nuts"
I stand by it
Hahahaha
oh come on say it
"Nevermind, I am actually chill"
"doorcam voted for ""No"" in the poll."
God I just feel so Autistic
i for one like a vent sesh and am happy to help
Is this true about women?
"Appreciate the kind words folks, sorry to put this in the chat instead of my regular brand of proactive comedy"
Amen!!!!
more importantly women will always find a reason to be mad at u
"You didnât do anything, she just wasnât the person for you and thatâs ok! It sucks for sure, but you didnât do anything wrong"
People donât get less difficult the more you know them
I think itâs perfectly reasonable to be confused if just think of this as saving you a lot of figure grief
itâs giving bpd no shade
Especially at the start!
things should be easy! not confusing and hard
Iâm saying it was maybe not worth it considering itâs been confusing the whole time
My vote is not in regards to your situation I just think you are one of the few people in the chat who shouldnt ever be confused and it is wrong if you ever are
"Yeah, we were like having a perfectly fine night and then she kinda just broke it off and started citing all these small weird moments we had"
"Mitchie changed their vote to ""No"" in the poll."
but also this kind of pattern this early on? maybe ya dodged a bullet
"Mitchie voted for ""Yes"" in the poll."
no i would be genuinely so confused
"Oh yeah, no I feel like she was giving off mixed signals this whole time. And also sheâs just been weird in general, like the night she randomly seemed pissed at me before Iâd spoken to her despite nothing having happened between us and then she was fine the next time I saw her"
"Eric Sony and Hypnosis voted for ""Yes"" in the poll."
"Samuel Housing Authority voted for ""No"" in the poll."
bacon egg and cheese created a poll: Is Andrew wrong for being conf...
clear sign that your communication skills need work
I thought this would be a poll
Am I wrong for being confused by this?
"And also doesn't want to text, which is a boundary I've been respecting."
The girl I've been seeing ended things with me last night and she said it was because we aren't communicating well. But we've been on like 4 dates and she specifically told me she wanted to take it slow.
Id consider it the main point of the chat
Go off
Can I poll the chat on a question about my personal life please?

Ok I'm off until January 1st
Did it spill over the rail
The balcony
Onstage?
"Imagine I get onstage and fall right over, cheetos spilling everywhere"
If the audience were good I would have swept them up myself and used them for my entrance
Ok last night I saw a man at LF trip and spill a bag of cheetos and it truly made me laugh harder than any comedy show
Iâve heard mixed things
How was it
at a y2k screeening and itâs empty
I submitted a bunch of old ones to the treasurer and it still hasnât cleared
You might be able to cash that in directly to the bank to avoid the treasury
They take so long to cash in
Just not like dying laughing or anything
Audience is listening
It's not bad!
13!
How many audience members are there @Johnbo Walter Stockwell ?
WHAT THE SAM HELL!
The important thing is that the comedy show continues even if itâs bad and nobody wants to be there
Cowboys been tucking himself in recently
"I feel so bad dude, the energy in here is rough"

Was it good? I want to see it

is y2k any good?
Gah every pic of her goes hard
Missing her
Yeah that's the worst part
Ya and I think opposition is doubling coming down on him and trying to make his shortcomings more of a thing to point to never electing like a teacher or left leaning guy again
But that's kind or more vibe based than anything
I also think maybe he wasn't the best choice for CTU to tap for the nomination and he's having the pay the price for not being a food enough politician to do the job well
It's really good
Anybody play chants of sennaar
Become a comedian?
I think with Brandon Johnson a lot of people (on both sides of the issue) arenât loving how heâs handling the migrant crisis
I think @Anthony Siraguse said he surrounded himself with a bad/incompetent team
I feel like he's doing not a great job overall but also all the videos I see of him and the comments are def heavily pushing an agenda
"Love the vibe, but I'm neutral on the taste"
IDK about the Brandon johnson stuff
Diet Coke propaganda has been everywhere lately
Iâd be right there with her ð«¶
"I saw someone yelling at the meeting today, and I was like, ""where's this coming from?"""
Lisa Barlow marches on Washington
Is it holding up pension payments?
I don't get that part
"Yeah, but like why do normal people care?"
Itâs like how rfk said heâs going to get rid of Diet Coke as soon as trump is inaugurated
he keeps holding off the budget
Does anyone know why emotions are high with Brandon Johnson?
No it's bc tiktok is where everyone is finding out about genocide and they don't have control over the flow of information in the same way
I'll have an update for you tomorrow on progress
I started working on em today
Hahahahahahahaha
They found out how much storage space they were paying for when they saw all the unread Tik Toks in John and Aaron's inbox from me
But who knows
I feel like Congress sees it as more of an existential risk if China has access to that data
iâm gonna go non verbal
no one should be allowed to benefit from your data unless they work for a good old fashioned american company
this is happening to protect you from china
why
wait why is this happening to us
"Oh man, chat is gonna have a rough week"
it is so much worse than tt it's kinda crazy
no ik that's why I was trying to figure out reels
i have like a severe addiction and idk how iâm gonna handle being cold turkey
wait this is like really not good for my whole thing i got going on where i lay in bed and watch tiktokâs until danny gets worried
it's truly bullshit
And weâre all headlining

Are you sure it's only $80?!
You know someone about to end up in the ER for sticking they dick in this
Wait so it was like a 30 year bond???
That's so funny

My mom is sending me a $50 savings bond from when I was born now worth $82
Huge score
Yes you should it will be very well received by the public
it's pretty funny
I probably will
Rebecca told me to!
I think the comments will be really fun
You should post this video of your wife crying while you laugh and videotape her
And came to me like this yesterday
Rebecca was reading the invisible life of addy la roux
It was either you or another girl who only reads about Neurodiversity
Caroline I added you on Goodreads
One was just her Goodreads burner account
I had to stop bc it was proving difficult to keep it straight from my ooze and muck fear tracking app
stopped using goodreads bc the app is quite bad
i searched for you on goodreads & there were two caroline twymans. took a lot of detective work to figure out if you were the one who just read Hunger Games or the one who read Women in Tech
https://www.goodreads.com/friend/i?feature=friend-invite-url&invite_token=NjZlYmZjMzUtNDFiMi00NGM4LWI0NDgtM2EyZmQ3NDhjYzhl
Looks like Avi has a lot more going on internally than his pa

Thank u kings
Or a screw extractor
Iâll look for pliers
And thank you WAYFAIR
Ohhh good idea thank you !!
"Since the threads are exposed on the opposite side, easiest solution might be to grip it with pliers on that end and twist"
In a pinch you can use the Allen key with it but put some aluminum foil around it and shove it in until you have enough grip to turn it
Maybe if you can grip it with pliers you can unscrew it
You need a screw extractor
Advice ð­

"You're right, that was rude of me I'm sorry Caroline"
okâ¦ anything to add to the conversation about my 2 year old nieceâ¦??? or are you going to continue to bring random commentary about the comedy community from which this chat was conceived?
"Sorry, just wanted to get that off my chest"
I can't stop thinking about how funny it is when guys like Vik Pandya promo themselves with rap music that shit cracks me up
2 year olds should be able to vote
i showed her a painting and she gasps âitâs gorgeousâ
i showed her my room and she went âoh itâs wonderful. thatâs a great room for youâ
iâm hanging out with my 2 year old niece (almost 3) and i gotta say i am sorry to everyone who has tweeted about shit their 2 year old said.
We skipped rocks together

I always think film parties are going to be really fun but they can veer towards a sort of awkwardness
Yeah thatâs sick I saw that
He made a movie with the lead of Brandon's movie that I did small part in
Jacob is at a film maker party and texted me
Ian how did u find out
I love that when you started film school the domino effect was your hog in Sundance
My weiner is in Sundance
I was thinking of jacobs
Wait oops
@Maddie Daviss !! U starred in that
Wait holy shit
Whoa thatâs sick
so cool!
That is HUGE news that rules
woAAAAH
Noooooo way thatâs awesome holy shit congrats !!
"@Aaron Klinger, father of one @Bruce Kesselring apparently Brandon's movie that we were in made it to Sundance"
Iâm in here
Oh never mind I accidentally snuck into first class
Hour train ride for $5
Taking a day trip from Tokyo to a seaside town
On a train rn things really cool

but thats probs not ideal for like film stuff
i feel like the only thing people have told me is the thing we did for witches where we fill a condom and snip the top. I think its easier with actual fake blood not just like water. For dritty's dreamland i put a bunch in my like shirt pocked and smacked them really hard when i got shot and it exploded nicely????
apparently this was my last search on goodreads in 2012 (edited)
apparently this was my last search on goodreads
should i start a goodreads or do you think it would make me too much of a target
"@Aaron Klinger, father of one"
Did you officially change ur party to the 21st?
Wait bruce
That ain't me
ð
People kept telling me to do it
Who did it?
i forgot about that

Didnât shower headed to the office holiday party in a few hours hope someone does a truly keg stand
ð¥°

smdh
Dummies
For the Gethard Show they were like âany idea you can think of our crew can make it happen! We havenât been unable to do anything yet!â And I asked for squibs and they were like âwe canât do thatâ
Just shoot someone for real
No but itâs hard to research for some reason!! Let me know if you find anything!
Does anyone have any experience making squibs
That's a really good deal
costco memberships r $20
Yeah I did it with them one time and I wanted to give real football analysis and they just wanted to screw around and talk about cum or whatever
They fully are it's wild
Feels very stupid to still be smoking out of a vape after laying eyes on this beauty. Hbd mad Dogg
Hahahahahaha
iâve showered but i still smell like truly
Wait itâs gorgeous
The thoughtful bonger
Me neither but now that I have one that has such pleasing aesthetics that would appeal to a Brooklyn based bookshelf I can bong with ease
What a beautiful smoking piece
Brings me back to the good ol days
Lol I haven't ripped a bong in a good long while
itâs BEAUTIFUL
My boyfriend got me a bong made by a graphic designer for my birthday
I do too itâs called ABCâs Lost and Iâm rewatching it
People love having something on the background while they look at their phones
Bennett streams himself watching the packers. I truly think some folks are just super lonely
I donât understand streaming but I kinda think people might tune into that
So people can watch us having fun
Every time you host something there you should put up a stream
Big hbd to maddie!!!!
Happy birthday Maddie!
Happy birthday Maddie!
Didn't get a chance to send my birthday gif
happy MADDIE DAY
I'll get a twitch stream up
Yes
so we can all know how the perg is doing at all times
Depop Perg sounds like a post modern hip-hop artist
can you share the feed
Installed cameras last night so I can keep an eye on the perg
The natural way to demo ð¥°
"10 pitbulls would be like hiring that goat-herd brush clearing service, but for demoing your house"
Thank you I WILL keep at it
Weird how her unit needed renovations ð¤
Should I put my pergola on depop?
IT GETS BETTER!!!!
Hahahahahahahaha
Fuck I should have went to the party! I didnât know thereâd be gossip like this!!!
Noâ¦..no this canât be true!!! This is insane!!!!
Thereâs apparently a woman in a temporary unit here while hers is being renovated that has 10 pit bulls in it haha
Hahaha insane behavior
i was likeâ¦. cool!
Missing Parrots right about now â¤ï¸
tbh i didnât get drunk til the end bc the first hour of the party was spent having ameerah sanders tell me she used to hate me but now she doesnâtâ¤ï¸
Not even nameable
"Damn, a bar worse than Galway Bay???"
i was out til 4 am at some bar by galway bay
INCREDIBLE!!!!
And then it coming full circle when I found out Gena and Ali were eating with her and DID eat steak
My highlight was talking to Tori and her telling me how she ended up getting chicken at a steak restaurant
"Damn, I feel like I missed part of the night"
lmao late as hell ð¤£
Just woke up ð
Last night was a movie
"Saw it, I feel like it was a reclaiming moment"
yknow what no I'm gonna maintain some dignity here
"I wouldâve been fine with that, once someone opened my car door puked, closed it, and tipped me like $30, it ruled"
Jeffrey Trent
Mitch who was the fourth guy
I was like damn maybe I couldâve learned something
"Mitchell, Noe and a white guy I donât remember had so many rules for beer pong that I regretted dropping  out of college"
And then Jonah and I played beer pong
Joey and I played beer pong
What happened at da party
Btw Iâm drunk this morning not hungover yet
In a way Iâm still there
No one knows
How late did you end up staying?
I was so full of love and Christmas spirits that I thought Iâd break into the old place in Avondale
ð
Took me all the way to Brooklyn
I also gave him Adam McShaneâs address somehow
I threw up in the Uber and tipped him $40
Happy bitthday Ms Daviss!
Joey be nice
Except @Meg I meant it
I would like to apologize to everyone who I said âyouâre so funny you should keep at itâ at the w laugh factory Christmas party last night
Was going to send âhappy birthday to the Madd Hatter!!â With a photo of Maddie in a wig and replace âhattâ with âwiggâ but Iâm not going to do that
Happy beautiful birthday to our dearest Maddie Daviss
Happy Birthday 2 Beef O Brady
Happy birthday Maddie!
mad e-birthday vibes to jellifer nawrence!
Happy birthday to the chat rocker!!
happy birthday legend!!!!
Happy birthday @Maddie Daviss
is anyone still here iâve gone non verbal in the bathroom
Just a masterclass in making an apology
I love this apology because heâs still like âthe women I was close to in my early life still suck thoughâ
thanks for the nice intentions ian!
I had every nice intention of going but it's just a lil cold and late for me I think. Plus I have to be in office tomorrow and it's my office holiday party
leaving coleâs in like 20 min if anyone wants to hop on my uberâ¤ï¸
the short list gods came thru for me
Heading to lf!
People who are there/go gotta keep us updated if anyone makes a fool of themselves
"mitchie p is, for sure"
Are people at LF?
You guys went from soy boys  to soy men
One time I got sent to the school counselor bc of being at least twelve bodies
this is at least 12 bodies
But one time I got sent to the school counselor bc I copy and pasted weird al lyrics for an essay and it seemed very violent
I know this is like an Aaron random connection
Comedians who should move to New York and/or have a baby
I didnât know two of you when that was taken and now I do so
Alright
Should we know who you guys are?
How did they go
Great pic
Cysk auditions were 5 years ago
I thought u were asking if u could do his riff on the garbage hit and runner
Oh wait nvm
an all time insane thread
https://x.com/projectkim/status/1866955330023985356?s=42
I guess I'll rage
Fine
Whatever
the party probably is just starting around 10ish
no girl itâs the other way around
Just kidding I donât need credit I love stuff like this
Wait is everyone going late?
Not at all!! Just give me credit if it hits and donât mention me if it bombs
Might go to LF early so I can go to Cole's
I'm gonna try this at Cole's lol
You care if I do this on stage Richie?
Unless people so choose that is
would LOVE for people to come hang
Also would anyone want to meet at Coleâs to pregame LF  in like an hour? NOT to go up Kristi dw just to hang
what time are folks going to LF
ð
That was by accident but I think the sentiment stands
ð
Do NOT send me the fb invite
What time are people going to LF
Be there soon
nobody go to coleâs tn thank u
I'm going
oh frick i donât think i can. make meaningful lifelong connections for me!
iâm like ðð letâs hang out with some of the randomest people in the nation all together
whoâs going to LF party
girl i guess
we the intelligentsia were exchanging ideas
iâm back
omg it works
hello
why canât i go on instagram and messenger
whatâs going on
That's really smart to have thought to done that
yeah i came up with remembering this just now
That's a really beautiful poem ð¢
Did u just come up with that
"I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind pretending not to see their needs?

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could've been any clearer
If they wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream (washed out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)
And no message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)
And no message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place)
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)

(You gotta get it right, while you got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart) you can't
(Then you close your) close your, your mind
With the man in the mirror, oh yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

(Oh yeah) gonna feel real good now

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Come on (change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it
Yourself (yeah)

(Make that change)
I've got to make that change today
(Man in the mirror) you got to
You got to not let yourself brother
(Yeah) you know
(Make that change) I've got to get that man, that man

You've got to
You've got to move
Come on
Come on
You got to
Stand up, stand up (yeah, make that change)
Stand up

Stand up and lift
Yourself, now
(Man in the mirror)

(Yeah, make that change)
Gonna make that change come on
(Man in the mirror)

You know it
You know it
You know it
You know
Change
Make that change"
yeah to that iâll say
And insulted you'd say it is
Not the same
"Sorry, it's not."
yeah iâve been running in shorts and figure itâs similar
It's pretty nice
I've been doing cold plunges on my legs after skateboarding
Ooof
i have not and i canât believe i ever did that. it was so cold
That may be the difference here
Have you been keeping up on cold plunging?
i donât think luigi should have yelled at the media but iâm no vigilante
my close personal friend avatara
is instagram down
Just leave behind a Drive Damage Depart sticker
But I could hit-and-run a CEOs car
I'm not quite hardcore enough to do the full Luigi
The hit and runner's manifesto
"Drive
Damage
Depart"
"Damage
Dump
Demolish"
I can't believe they'd put in this much planning just to take out your means of transportation
"This is like when Luigi Mangione shot that CEO, but it's a city worker and your car"
It's nice you got the note
Is ur car drive able
Idk but people left a note with a plate number
Are u gonna be compensated
How did u find out
Damn that sucks man
A sanitation truck hit my parked car
This is really really funny
it was obv tasty but the best thing was watching all the like Bridgeport lifer groundskeeping old dudes be like âwhat da hell is this? I donât know about soup you eat with chopsticksâ¦â
it was soo sick
the only thing getting me through the day is that they had a pho bar at the white sox employee cafeteria
In light of recent events I will now always be coated in a layer of our experimental bulletproof lotion for men
"it was more like ""so crazy that Luigi did that. I actually know his family"""
no his family is like prominent in Baltimore
I'm actually cool if you get me
I'm not like other ceos
Is he trying to be like a pick me ceo
Yeah what was his take or perspective?
I bet he was like at the same country club party as them
the ceo is from Maryland so is probably just bragging about proximity to wealth
I would instantly stop liking him if I knew he bought from this company
Do you guys sell trigger finger lotion
Look him up in the system and see if he bought anything
Canât believe messenger is out when I just heard the tiege ceo say that he knew Luigiâs parents
Kingdom Come: Deliverance
Lemme boot it up right now and check
I feel like Iâd love that
Which game
And play my game about being a medieval peasant
Just wanna chill
I'm struggling to work these past few days
Office vibes are particularly bleak today
weird phone who dis
yeah one sec my phone is weird
Did you also send the response?
I don't know that it is
is it not sending
"""I know we have a long history, and the kids miss you, but I'm featuring you in a piece I'm writing for the New Yorker."""
like i sucked ur thumb for two hours one night ago threee years ago dont talk to me like im ur ex wife
ok but donât u hate this response
hahaHAHAHA
Thatâs much better than him asking about the ass cookies
Oh lol
however it is all about the tramp stamp show promo
so i assumed it was my latest reel
oh wait yeah forgot to update its not the reel its roadkill show poster actually i was scared to open it at first
Yeah weird! If it was a listicle or something itâd make sense if he wanted a quote or something to add to it but
"i asked him what hes writing about and he said a column on organic promo that hes ""sending to many industry people"" and then sent "" ur welcome xx"""
i think its weird that he wasnt like hey im thinking about writing about u for this what do u think
hes a social media analyst thats not the weird part to me
Why would he need the insights
To ask for food in want I make the animal noises ð¯ðµ
"""featuring it for an article"""
Lmfao
ask if iâm ok w that first? hahahaha
does he have to like
"that stamptown brother i hooked up w three years ago just randomly DMd me âcan i have the insights for ur latest reel, featuring it on an articleâ"
I hear if you die in Japan you die in real life
Yeah I guess
That would probably happen here too honestly
A guy mean mugged me bc I showed his girl shrek
At a club in Japan and kept showing girls pictures of shrek
I would honestly love to see the vibe
"Damn, true!"
Isnât that better than work??
"But consider this: you get to pay $5 to watch other people who think paying $5 for an open mic is a good idea, and you canât leave"
4pm on a Wednesday is a horrible time
"And I canât, I work normal hours"
I know the host!
Fear City indeed
you couldn't design a worse open mic
-arbitrary threats of banning
"-no list, chosen at random"
-being punished for showing any time before 3:55
-Pay to go up
-4PM
I'll venmo you $5 to go to this
you need to go for me
What schizophrenic posted this?
You can tell all of NYâs best comics go to this mic
Iâve walked by it and been bummed out just by the vibe from outside
This place seems awesome
"Also sorry, but being banned from Fear City comedy club is like being banned from Kansas. I wasnât going anyways"
I think itâs cool to pay for something and get banned for having to leave a bit early
Idk I think itâs about time that somebody made open mics feel like a bad time
Hellish vibe!
Getting Christmas cards ready
I liked it!
Thinking about defending my polycueâs honor
Pretty good!
Any you seen Black Doves on Netflix
genuinely amazing post
Who's he talking about?
On my insta story
JFL Vancouver haha reacted to how I said I was flicking the bean to their poster
YES!!
what doesnât he know that we do
what does he know that we donât
I canât wait for a waiter to get fired over this
i watched english teacher the other nightâ carmen was very how you would expect!
carmen christopher randomly looking at my tiktok
Actually Jonah is admin
Yea please!
Do you need an add to the non-jewish group chat?
Iâm straight and Christian now
You guys
"Awww, I was gonna premiere my Dump Humper joke"
i donât want to be there
actually yeah pls donât come tomorrow
bc victoria asked me to be last shift hahaha
but i wonât be mad if nobody shows up so my night can end early
I hope youâre first shift â¤ï¸
yes
Is Coleâs gonna happen tomorrow?
I love that you guys can track when I take my adderall
I put this up and wanna get back into it
Anyone wanna collab on making stuff like this around town
last year willie griswold asked me if i was doing ok and i told him to mind his business
i got black out drunk last year
When's the johnmedy holiday party
Now
Everyone should have an invite
They keep forgetting to book me too
Crazy how they somehow forgot all of us?
Me too in addition as well pls
Absolutely
can you do the same for me
Just sent it to you
Is there an FB event for the LF party? I feel like there usually is one
Love it
Mitch lowkey a sassy brat
I'm gonna ask 14 comics who I've never spoken to if they want to produce a lodge show with me
I'm gonna tell everyone they were snubbed by the gazellies this year
Itâs incredible
People who do two mics a year walk up to you and just say âIâm doing some networking with you right nowâ
It's one of the rare times all of my favorite people and all of my least favorite people are in the same room
I canât wait
Itâs the best people watching day of the year
I'm gonna tell Katie Zane to keep at it
I thought it was usually thursdays but I'm gonna go and get so drunk that I tell Chicago's worst comedians that I love them
It seems feral
Whatâs the vibe of it
No tomorrow
wait is the LF party tonight?
no I'm asking
I feel like they usually cancel it the week of the holiday party
"Oh yeah, maybe the mic is off?"
LF holiday party is this week?
Just in case
Bring your packet
Mostly a place to network for laughable news
Go with the expectation you will not be performing
Tough to get on
"Yeah, it's fun"
Has anyone done the laugh factory mic before
No
Nvm
Is In lieu of gi anything
"Thereâs a guy here who keeps saying he looks like Luigi and itâs likeâ¦buddy, you look nothing like him"
I want the whole chat to go
If you guys donât go to Japan Iâm gonna be so mad
I keep meeting Israelis who are hot :(
new years resolution is to write more manifestos
everyone maintain joint mobility please ð literally move your joints to keep em healthy especially your back
honestly the biggest takeaway iâve learned so far is to never get back surgery
the 5th grader i tutored had experience in this assassin game
"https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto

Manifesto dropped"

"currently writing about how there is so much merch for Luigi because of the rise of print on demand. Its so funny that every etsy seller selling ""deny, defend, depose"" tshirts also has MAGA shirts and pride shirts for sale in there shops"
https://shatterzone.substack.com/p/alleged-ceo-shooter-luigi-mangione
If you want a good take perchance
I concerned people are going to start slapping standups!!
I feel like so many journalists are disconnected from reality
do something ð«¶
Iâm just obsessed with the fact that the guy was a lindy man/paul skallas head
Waiting on the steakums x account to weigh in
But no company or brand is going to be like âwe agree with the internet! Itâs good that the ceo was killed!l
"Yeah so many people see it as the senseless taking of a life like any other murder, instead of a targeted attack of the head of a company that sent a message that desperately needed to be sent"
Nooooooooo
"Oh nooooo, shooters are going start trying to shoot rich, powerful, politically polarizing people????"
Because then every loser will want to be him instead of shooting innocent people at a mall
Thatâs why itâs cool that heâs hot and impressive
Targeted killings in
Mass shootings out
smdh
dont love the 4chanification of john stockwell
smdh
Next you're gonna ask what skibidi toilet is
Just sit in your apartment looking at the wall
Jesus Christ what do you do all day
"blaming everything i dont like on the ""4chanification"""
I guess these people will throw any garbage take against the wall tho instead of giving any sort of weight to the fact that an overwhelming majority of people like that this guy did that
"""this is just as bad as when incels celebrate school shootings!!!"""
The 4chanification
Lol what a stupid take
https://www.wired.com/story/the-internet-is-gripped-by-mangione-mania/
worst take alert
He excelled in evading the police after evading the goose in duck duck go
"Or like 

He did a mob hit, and we learned that him and his friends were a group that regularly role played as mob members. 

In the card game, Mafia,"
"Basically the equivalent of being like 

This murderer who killed a plumber has some experience with this because in college he played Mario video games"
Can someone explain to a non-gamer what this means
The humble comedian
Humble
I think some studios are selling cool art but I will just simply have photos of my friends doing plays and a bunch of beers
Spreading this invite far and wide cuz I think it will be very fun and also I owe everyone a beer for making you listen to my UHC shooter conspiracy theory https://partiful.com/e/O9LkYGZaNK6qLNJMrHdu
ð
âFeeling cool ðâ
Opportunity to have a cool roommate
idk why they would make up something like thaty
yeah don't be scared of that
I don't think that's true
someone said this means thereâs a waluigi working in private equity somewhere
Free Luigi
Damn
Like what the fuck
I'm diving deep into this luigi stuff man

Getting paid to poop is one of the small pleasures of working. And nobody will question it because itâs embarrassing for them
Any relation to the satire writer Nate Odenkirk?
itâs been 20 min and they gotttaaa be wondering where i am but i do t wanna text my manager that im pooooping in a major way
stuck on the toilet at work itâs hell on earth
The perfect spot to reflect
heâs repped by naomi odenkirk!
"Which is maybe why he was just hanging in a McDonalds, I mean"
"I think this is 100% right, I was thinking about how America is so accustomed to senseless violence that when there is a logic or sense to what someone did there is a immediate sympathy and kind of assuming he's a genius. But he can be both kinda smart and also kinda manic and not thinking through what would happen afterwards"
lol
Jake Prizant is in a Potbelly ad?
but i do magnesium and ashwagunda and cortisol reducers
ok not to out myself as a hippie
I use a drug called marijuana (spelling?) when I'm anxious
Not a book and maybe unhelpful but I know people who have taken magnesium pills to help with anxiety symptoms
I've heard those are good idk my brain is fine
"The worry trick, the untethered soul, the art of letting go"
I have it in my hotel room Iâll try to find it
Teaches you to be your friend along da way
Oh um I think this self compassion book goes hard
Quran
How to gain friends and win influence
"Sorry chat, but does anyone have any book recs for dealing with anxiety? I've got some goals I'm trying to achieve that are definitely not related to recent news events"
Also new sick jacket for cheap
Some Russians did a photoshoot with me
"Now that the dust has settled a little bit from today, it needs to be appreciated how fucking funny it is that William Banksâs big project that heâs been working on for *months* was launched on the day of the biggest arrest and jailing in recent history"
I also believe he had a lot of actual material
I love what Ryan's doing onstage and am laughing with not at him ftr
It kind of intersects with laughing at him
it also would have been a 2 hour and 30 min show but mike robinson dropped
"Like, you can give him the phone book, and it would be fun to watch him read it"
"Like, they don't make jokes, they just ARE and it's funny to watch"
ryan did so bad that grace called kiehron in to drop in after his set
That's the category of comic he falls into. I've seen them before
I was real stoked to see you did Rib tips at lf
not only was it two hours long but it was 2 hours and fifteen minutes
Also how was your 30?
Wait can you confirm that this show is 2 hours long
im genuinely confused if people are making fun of him or like him
What if she had her period halfway through
I donât think a woman could do that set
IDK!!!
i feel like if a girl did that set they simply wouldnât book her
Poor kid
But I also get how he could bomb for 30 minutes straight lol
"Yeah, he's one of those people whose jokes aren't for anyone? idk how to describe it. I like seeing him on stage"
Hahahahahahahahahaha
I'm all in on Ryan
He crushed for 65 minutes straight at his laugh factory show
it was silent for 30 min
he followed me at headliners
Where are you watching Ryan do 30 mins?
Does anyone emotionally connect to this hat
One day he's gonna be a 40 year old man who acts like that
This is his past life
Heâs not meant for this timeline
"He is supposed to be a 1930âs dustbowl vagrant working for beans from farm to farm, train to train"
i just donât get whatâs real iâm confused
iâm like is he trying to do like joe pera core
He donât seem like a tantrum guy
Unless theyâre throwing a tantrum
No one really bombs on purpose
Idk man
I think he thinks they just donât get it
heâs walked five people so far heâs half way thru his half hour
or is he just binning
is ryan oliver going for like bombing
ok iâm confused
Bought this bad boy
and then we can decide the pope of the chat
When you see it weâll add you to conclave chat
I saw it as well! (With @Adrienne Stout)
i loved it!
@Adrienne Stout saw it!
Might fuck around and hit up a matinee tomorrow
Hate to distract from the assassin talk but has anyone in the chat seen conclave
Wonder if Luigi and William Banks are in the same jail
iâve heard of a haircut but thatâs ridiculous
Dude paid attention to literally each strand of hair
conspiracy twitter discovering the concept of a scatterbrained genius
Knows his angles
Gotta hit the gym and work on my assassin bod
he sounds like an esfj
Murder for a cause is so sigma
Heâd be a hero to everyone
I feel like inmates would love him
the fact is that he was a meatball but the question is was he neurospicy. weâll have to wait to see the court evidence
I want a John wick quiet gun
And no one catch him
It would have been so sick for CEOâs to live in permanent fear
I saw a video of someone using the same gun setup and it's literally silent. It's just clicking noises lol that insane that that's legal
Eating a cheeseburger was actually the activation action for my and hundreds of other sleeper cell ivy league school Andrew huberman trained assassins
Italian intuition
The silencer and the weird bullets
;)
he should have gotten time and a half to prepare
I'm just so curious how he got that insane load out
Very Italian to lower your mask to flirt
Maybe he had sensory sensitivities and had to let the skin breathe
a slightly impulsive meatball
i guess itâs a trade off between looking normal and being camouflaged but seems very not smart to have been bare faced on surveillance
If he wore a prosthetic  face I think he wouldâve gotten away with it
united healthcare is so bad
Bro
ð¤
E-girl hiding in cakes
People are gonna break into jail to fuck him
lol
iâm gagged
iâm sorry but the girl i had every class at depaul with making it in this post
Hot guy name I guess!
Can I just add a random Italian as a placeholder
Oh nvm
Would we be on a watchlist if I add him to the chat
all his socials are deleted now
His was different somehow
We must've not been smoking the same weed
Heâs just like every dude I smoked weed with in college for real
That's all Trump does about healthcare lol
Goddamn
It would be such a wild card if Trump pardoned him
Michell Potts Pardon Power 2025
Not if I have anything to say about it
"Damn, imagine if the trump shooter lived to hear himself get compared to this chad"
He'll see it in 2060
Just the word ârespectâ
Joe has DMâd him
They don't have the chops
Are we competing with Joe Eames chat?
"So this is how brat summer ends. Not with a whimper, but a bang."
I only just got around to following him on IG and let me tell ya: we are not the only group chat thirsting after our boy Luigi
"I know heâs probably dealing with a lot, but I do wonder if part of him is like âmy boys chat is going off right nowâ"
"adding ""Kill Bluecross CEO"" to my goals"
going over my self evaluation for the year
UHG killer was ted cruz
the moment it dawns on us
one of my fav days in the chat thus far
chat today
william banks
source?!!!?
Gotta add him to the chat
confirmed bisexual
wait heâs bi
I wish we could add him to the chat
Heâs one of charliâs angels ð¼
If he'd finished level 5 those bullets would have said zip zap zop
Representation is so important
Somebody on Twitter confirmed that heâs taken at least one improv class
Heâs so foine
wish i could DM her lol
That is absolutely wild
Oh my god
i had like every depaul class w the girl in this pic
a girl i went to depaul with is his friend
going back to the assassin
Go off
this day is a rollercoaster
god i have more gossip
Canât stop watching sister wives today
its absolute reddit humor
Heâs already got a guy throwing gang signs
"Like, the idea of the bit is funny but I feel like heâs going to hit some pretty rough stereotypes"
Like itâs an annoying movement but even lamer to not get that itâs a joke as a comic
"Thereâs a comic at that laugh factory that has a bit about this but she doesnât understand itâs a joke, so she just looks silly"
It feels like when Elon Musk references Dogecoin
It's really lame
Or he shouldve filmed his court trial and found out that the judge has a car world tattoo
itâs been fun playing journalist i cannot lie
Iâm going to New York this weekend and Iâm going to free him from his bit
he just needs to post this
Itâs very easy actually to end the bit without âgoing backâ which is just be like âthey released me from prison early due to good behaviorâ
"clare austen smith , bianca, ian lockwood"
few sources
iâve gone too far i canât go back
like literally so âis a hotdog a sandwich-coreâ
and he is like
i guess one of his friends talked to him and was like u can really stop this u know
Who is your source or is it confidential
Thatâs awesome and will go over well
I cannot stand the birds arenât real thing
heâs gonna release videos this week of him being beat up by actors in his fake jail
god i have even more info
The alt comedy dark web
That's pretty crazy
Whoa....
and itâs all being paid for by the Birds Arenât Real guy
so he rented out an old jail
i got more william info
Biden has the opportunity to do the funniest pardon of all time
i fucking love him
heâs soooo funny
He linked his google plus account really wish I could get in there
planning his signature look perhaps
love that the only thing he pinned was a hoodie
mein craft
Memes
ð

Iâd say it isnât entirely devoid of racism
The sausage was rlly good too but I think I was expecting something else
The spring rolls went crazy
Damn how were the sausage and spring rolls
We are instagram friends now
That's the plate
Good rec Ty
That's it
Oh Ian I went to Thailand restaurant yesterday
Found his Pinterest
https://www.pinterest.com/lnmangione/
Japan tv rocks
This is good stuff
Maybe God is real
seems like everyone is mad at him and eric yates is defending him
LITERALLY
"I will say that since the prison thing is a bit, I have to wonder what kind of thought process went into hiring those two guys for the pictures lol"
In mine craft parody etc
Why can't we do the same with alt comedians
The FBI does it with mentally ill people all the time
Honestly we should be enabling William Banks to be the next Mangione
this is also happening
while this is happening
"Expecting Tinder bios to say âsorry, must be taller than me and willing to murder capitalist pigsâ"
Sentiment remains
I saw it lol
First unsend â¤ï¸
"Sorry dude, hot people are on top again"
Hot people need to stay in their lane
Do we know how tall he is yet
I think it's bullshit he's hot ngl
Did you pay?
Hahaha did not know about this
what if the guy who killed Unitedhealthcare ceo was a guy who venmo requested me 2.75 for a 7/11 slurped
It's the confidence
Proof hot people are superior
Iâd do a 180 on Nate in an instant
itâs actually famous nepo baby nate odenkirk
oh fuck they just released itâs not him now
Human resources meme irl
And then the guy who tried to get trump and failed was some fugly loser
It's funny that the successful universally loved assassination was perpetrated by a hot guy
Let him host!!! ððð
i fucking love him
"Damn, he's chill"
Hahahahahahahaha
Put your degree to good use
Kill lorne Michaels
Try and kill someone
asssassins dad wrote for snl
You should catch up
industry plant like bobbi althoff
This is like that but if the Boston marathon were evil
Remember when the Boston marathon bombed was hot
relax heâs a one hit wonder
Wanna feel old? Luigi Mangione was only 26 when he killed Brian Thompson
i canât even get a sales job
wait heâs literally my age
Heâs a nepo baby
Omg I just found out this guys dad is Mark David Chapman
Uh yeah Iâd be assassinating ceos too if my parents paid my rent!
"And thus, entrepreneur in bio"
People romanticize the working class but those guys are all busy watching Sunday night football. You need some ambition to take out a ceo
"Yeah, to me!"
He has the jawline
Well heâs âperson of interestâ
And maybe we just found a hot Italian guy who loves the Unibomber
wait really
Hey thereâs still a chance this isnât the guy
god heâs sooooooo hot
ok i caught the insta before it started popping letâs see how many followers he gets
lmao his insta
Iâm so bummed NYPD seemed truly too stupid to fine him
And I love that he's a private school ivy League guy. elitism in a good way
Iâd be so embarrassed if I was assassinated by an uggo
So sick that itâs a hot guy
Hahahahaha
Does anyone have any good screenshots for when Shankland does something like this
should I connect?
i dated him
Oh we're about to hear from anyone who dated him in high school
It's funny that like when more or this stuff happens we're gonna be seeing what they posted on linkedin and letterbox
On that Sacco and Venzetti shit
He makes some good points that I was just about to make
Hell yeah I knew we could count on the Italians
thatâs a spicy meatball

Luigi Mario?
He's the suspected guy?
I wonder if they will publish the manifesto
And is going to draw a lot of attention
I'm honestly happy it's a guy with a statement and anti health insurance
Luigi M has a pretty solid Goodreads page
It worked on me. I'm about to go hit that dislike button as fast as I can.
Like who's reading that and going damn ok!
Do u think that message has worked on anyone?
"""Chicago's biggest names in production"""
That's so funny
Hahahahahahahahaha
"I know, this is huge"
Should be fine imo
I am not sure it could go either way

i forget who it was but it was some instagram medium. she encouraged us to network with each other and cultivate our intuition so i tried to schedule a call with another girl but she kept rescheduling and then i got a software job.

poop fucker is the best thing to happen to this chat for a while
They like boomer dad humor sry

I feel this is off-brand for you

Let Trisha Paytas host!!! ððð
i never asked them if they thought he was hot or not....
i asked my parents what they thought of snl last night & they both went on & on about how they dont think paul mescal is hot
This is giving me brain worms
I was on fb marketplace
"Theyâre pretty chill though, you should be good!"
They might give a little stink but only because they sell coffee there
Will music box let me bring a coffee in?

The kid is still in the class today?
And you're basically the CEO of the classroom
I would say that but they're probably gonna be all hopped up on that UnitedHealth CEO thing
You should hit the toughest kid first so they know that youâre the boss
You have kid puncher class?
I've got that class after lunch wish me luck

Hell are they hiring??

And itâs closer to my apartment than when I worked in midtown and I work only 9-5 as opposed to 8-6 like I did
That's the spirit
Gonna be honest? Easiest job Iâve ever had though
Hey Sam this job sounds like it sucks!
And everyone was very chill about it
"Today, there was a woman who barricaded herself and someone else in their apartment and was like making threats and cops got called and ALSO in another building, a guy got shot and killed"
Still fine I think

I thought it was about if a police officer a native American a sailor and a construction worker got gym memberships
Likeâ¦thereâs no way to not come off as homophobic with  that
Itâs a pretty incredible thing to sue someone about
"The quote is âitâs about black guys hanging out, thereâs nothing gay about thatâ"
I just read an article about how the guy from the village people who wrote ymca is going to start suing news networks for calling it a gay anthem
That's a big leaders who lead opportunity

you used to be able to smoke on the plane! people dressed up!
I mean itâs sooo annoying to fly now!
Thatâs the world I wanna live in
Imagine killing the ceo of your airline cuz your flight got delayed
Right but thatâs a manufacturer
well u really want the boeing ceos to be found in a ditch
Iâm less hardline about airline ceos but I did learn yesterday that ultimately Iâm fine with them getting killed too
gonna watch the joker tn
When I realized it was the healthcare company I was immediately like oh yeah well he should die
I thought it was the other United though so I was confused
I was on a date last night and she really didnât like how glad I was that the guy was murdered
Theyâre stoked!
wait i thought everyone was lowkey excited
* watching someone get murdered * Iâll have what heâs having
"Yeah, only if after we get murdered we go to Katz!"
*bleeding out in the street* only in New York
"Bro Iâll be in New York next week letâs do the legendary hang of Starbucks, photo op, getting murdered"
This city never sleeps! Manhattan is always a party
"What if the bullets said ""pussy, money, weed"""
I was like damn thats hardcore but if that's what we're doing I'm onboard
I only skimmed the headline yesterday and thought everyone was real excited about the ceo of united airlines getting killed
If you're going to pull something crazy like this you'd be stupid not do do something like that
Somebody posted this in the Simpsonâs Reddit and itâs perfect
It's like ok one guy getting killed in the street like a dog is sad in itself but don't ask me to mourn for him any harder than the literal millions of people who have suffered and died far worse deaths due to the (very profitable) choices made by people like this guy
kinda wild heâs still at large
I saw this really good quote from Mark twain that I think sums up how many people are feeling about this incident
Also he was wearing a camera backpack lol
Thatâs why in the video heâs constantly pulling the back of the gun
"The gun didnât jam, heâs using subsonic rounds that donât automatically eject so he has to eject them by hand, the subsonic rounds with the silencer made it much much quieter"
Also whatâs crazy
Some riddler ass shit
Also whatâs crazy about the assassin he left bullets that had written on them words like âdefendâ âdenyâ âdeposeâ
I saw them
They flirted at a party
mf not getting caught
She's a long time supporter of laughable news
Hahahahaha
i'm going to have a convo with her
why does my younger sister follow brian roe
"Yeah there were some stories of there saying he got away on a citi bike but now they're saying that didn't happen, nor sure what to believe in regards to that but he is still at large"
I think it's safe to say he knows someone who died or greatly suffered from the company fucking up their life because pretty much all of us know someone that's happened to
and he was just on a bike
I'm going to go out on a limb and say there was intent
"It's united Healthcare, they are notable for denying claims at a higher rate than other companies"
brian roe is a babe
like with intention or just random
wooooah
In da big apple
wait it was on a lime scooter but for bikes
A guy just walked up to a CEO of a major health care company and fucking smoked him
was he a bad guy
why did he get got
He was being too good at being a ceo
wait ok still havenât checked my phone in a major way  did a ceo get assassinated
Jesus fucking christ lol
Good song for the daft punk type fans tbh
This slaps
Hold on

My top track this year"
I think a lot of CEOs have gone in and out of court for anti trust or insider trading stuff. My impression is that it's sort of normal honestly
Too cold inside
Where are folks tonight?
Lmao that's a pretty good Photoshop
@Deborah Johnigan Protector any update from Deb??
Lmaoooooo get his ass
Am I seeing double?!?!?!?!
Easy choice
And unearned confidence
Bro has an ugly soul
Honestly so funny that women think he is hot until he starts speaking
Lol so many people have his face shape
Yes they have the same face shape
Anybody else get Brian roe vibes from Nick on love is blind
Jolly bean's burner account
Constructive criticism stings the most
"(I apologized, getting a hang of key phrases)"
"A museum worker approached me and some reason 
my first thought was my ween shirt was too casual for the imperial palace, it was for chewing gum"
I'm gonna submit a packet to laughable news
They were able to see straight thru all the production and jokes
Lol yeah it's crazy that Brian wasn't able to pull a fast one over on randos
know*
"Damn, even the randoms think it's bad"
Damn
He's gonna have to put the stream up early or he might crash the servers
Laughable News tomorrow is going to be ELECTRIC
The laughable news
Oh gosh
Canât wait for Brian Roeâs take on this whole thing
Hahahahahaha
Got smoked twice today
Damn he got smoked
13.5k laugh reacts
You do I'm just being a radical extremist
We all know the hierarchy goes this one health care CEO and then landlords are next
I feel like I make a good case ð¥º
And besides
You just have bad opinions
No of course nto
THE BIRTHDAY CURSE HAS NO EFFECT ON MY OPINIONS
He's the most establishment person in the group chat
I think they have camera footage of it
Well we should also take everything John says with a grain of salt
how do they know it was a citi bike and not just like his own electric bike
A high tourist and commuter area? Wherever he leaves that e-Citi bike it's getting used by someone else within the next 30 minutes
"Think about it, too"
There are def ways to get an electric citi bike and not have the account or card you're using traced back to you
"The options are 
1. On foot
2. Bike
3. Motorcycle?"
"Also, I feel like getting away on an electric Citi bike is the play in Manhattan, you can't drive a car down there, and anything else is public transit"
Really straight forward
"99% of the time, to unjam a gun, you basically just cock the gun again"
"Sincerely, not hard"
"Climate Conscious, healthcare defending king ð"
830
changed the location to rainbo club
iâve been running around looking for balloons
wait what was there a shooting
But of course they mispronounced it ð¤¦ #fml #NowWe'llNeverKnow
I just saw the clip where the Starbucks workers are trying to read the name written on the killers gun before they hand it off to him
"I just found a clip where you can hear the audio and the shooter goes âsir, will you sign my gun? Oh no! Itâs slipping out of my handsâ and then the gun goes off and he goes ânoooo I didnât mean to kill you!!!â"
Idk maybe more people will ruminate on stuff like this
It's like u got the shinzo abe guy and then this one
And idk maybe nothing will happen but if they don't find the killer or dif up more info
Well even if there was a conspiracy/something to cover up shareholders I think most people will probably buy that this was a frustrated citizen caught up in grievances
The citizens of kms avenue are hanging on by a thread
You guys please do not solve this. I need this
But at the end of the day I think it was just all a big misunderstanding that was actually also an accident
Citi bike thing is a good point that seems v trackable
no pressure i know thereâs this thing called coleâs tn
but probs 9pm bar time
time TBD weâre going to ahkoshi by mustache so weâre about to see how long weâre waiting
"""Yo what's up guys welcome to how to kill a CEO in broad daylight today's video is brought to you by DRAFTKINGS sportsbook"""
Tell him Happy birthday day from me
and iâm gonna surprise him at best intentions after dinner with pals
Yooo
itâs my boyfriends bday
but at the end of the day
wait sorry i know weâre in a big convo
I feel like based on these new conspiracy things arising this will be quickly memory-holed like the airline whistle-blower they killed
"But if I was shooting someone and my gun jammed I would look up how to unjam a gun youtube, skim through it, get to the part where they do it and watch it a couple times"
Also I donât know anything about guns
And you go to thailand and heâs drinking at the end of the bar
It would be wild if they never did
Itâs assumed that they will find him
He was buying the Starbucks New York mugs
Sorry if that's a dumb  question I don't want to learn things about NYC
Also are Citi Bikes not linked to your phone? Shouldn't they have like all of the guy's information?
I bet he got one of those Stanley cups and was killed for it ð
We donât know
Thatâs the thing
What was his order
ð£ï¸ ð£ï¸ ð£ï¸
Yeah either way we win
CEOs should be scared to be in public ð
But I really want to believe itâs a vigilante
No im getting to the bottom of this
But this is one where I kind of hope we just never know
Hell fucking yeah
I totally agree with you Matty
It feels more like a âweâre worried this guy is gonna flip mob style hitâ
Yeah I had no idea about the Starbucks camera but thatâs really interesting
Yea now youâre with me Mitchell
Yes!!!!!!! Thatâs what Iâm saying. It doesnât line up that he is on Starbucks cameras also????
I think someone not trained wouldâve panicked when the gun jammed
The assassin really seemed to know what they were doing
Cuz itâs like hell yeah
I want it to be angry guy for sure
No totallyyyyy
So I actually think the conspiracy angle is more likely but I find it more inspirational to believe it is a guy who had a claim denied
I think United healthcare is trying to make it seem like itâs an angry person who like had a claim denied
He rides one of the most trackable modes of transportation??????????
Idk like they have pics of him in a Starbucks??? This guy just wanted to be seen
Yeah it feels crazy they didnât catch him immediately
"In summary: insider trading, all the stuff about him being in a Starbucks right before the shooting and getting his photo taken and riding a Citibike????"
Alright fine Iâll listen to your podcast
It is well known that Joey has CIA ties
Hahahaha
Iâm sending a voice memo
Go on
I saw he was getting investigated for insider training
I had to write about it for work and I think it was an inside job sorry I really do
Wait guys I think it was a conspiracy
I just hope we don't see like record speed from congress passing legislation adding extra rights and protection to ceos
If we want any change we gotta get John hinkley jr off his meds
Io
^ example of something I would say if I was a crazy guy and not an honest citizen who would never wish harm on someone I love my government
Truly this needs to happen more!! These people need to be terrified to walk on the streets
Good fun violence works too
It may be! This could be huge!
King shit
Love that he biked away
"If this guy drops a merch store, you know Iâll be buying"
Sometimes violence IS the answer
My company had been BCBS for years and just switched to united for 2025
*gun
It's just nice to see that we are getting some good fun violence over here for once
Ya don't know if there's any hot takes on something that most people universally like or appreciate
goes without saying we approve
Checking in after a long day and honestly? Thought the chat was gonna have more hot takes on the united ceo
it probably is bc it says he works at stand-up comedian!! ð¤©
thats a name i recognize
was it david louis?
Mallory Bradford?
tina fey
Or Lewis?
David something?
A friend is asking who hosted the second city open mic in 2018?
Sold out I think idk this shit is goofy
Oh shit but they wear masks for this
Maybe tonight Iâll do music
I think Iâm gonna stick to the boxing
I wonder if wrestling would be more fun tho
My favorite anime has boxing tournaments here
It lacks awareness lol
"Lmao, I know, and I don't understand it either. I know cartoonists make like ""distinctive"" choices in their drawing style to distinguish their work from other artists? But this dude is kind of completely ripping off South Park in every other way"
I know you mean racist people but it really looks like youâre agreeing with a point heâs making
Why do all of their chins look like that
And a little bit Kamala Harris
"Sorry, it just seems to be Lawrence Fishburn"
He does the voice of every black person with an egregious blaccent
"every video this guy makes, he tags #adultswim lmao"
something I ALSO kindof really want
they have Gutfeld swag!!!!
It devastated me
My mom told me on thanksgiving that sheâs a big Greg Gutfeld fan
"""jokes"" is a strong word for it"
He's literally just ripping off South Park and making conservative oriented jokes
In Japan right now btw
I think it's because I was looking at the fox news shop maybe?
https://www.tiktok.com/@albarrycomedy?_t=8rwhY0BsaVD&_r=1
Even better!
"Also, here's something fun to hate watch that I just found"
Just get it as is
HAHAHAHAHA
This one is great because you can pretend that youâre a host
That is some unregulated emotional fuckery tho lol
Met her at my job and forever like her
I love her still tbh

"yeah, just steal the design"
get a cease and desist
Make your own
"god, I kinda want some fox merch, but I don't wanna support fox news"
"oh man, I'm gonna make a video about this"
I THINK YOU MEAN CHRISTMAS
HOLIDAY?!?!?!

lol fox news has an amazing merch shop
Aaron set his own nickname to the eastern mule.
Thought this would get some engagement in here
They didnât care in the slightest about anything
(This is very stupid and unnecessary)
Aaron set his own nickname to the drug mule of the east.
I successfully snuck in my ADHD meds by putting them inside other pills
Sucks I wasnât trusted enough
I wish I got the dm
which felt like type casting but whatever

Sorry I'm fucking stupid
Steven Springer
Do I gotta spell it out

Does anyone remember when the old guy was booked on fresh faces
No petition but Kristi definitely got a dm from her
And did anyone save it or screen cap it somewhere
Does anyone remember when Joe eames girlfriend made a petition to get gena kicked out of lodge because she was flirting with Joe
I have another project for the chat
Well I've gotta go to work now
Iâm down for a road trip
I kinda feel like I've done all I can do at this point short of driving it straight to her door
Yes
Was this her email? dajohnigan@cookcountycourt.com
"Audrey is asking her friend if she knows her, itâd be funny if it was Hannah"
Mary texted her friend Hannah who literally knows Audrey lol I think they work together
I returned it to his social worker to get it back to him
Circuit Court is what Audrey says
One time I found this teens wallet and he was homeless :(
Yeah
Yeah civil dept
Also you could probably bring it to the county building??
I just texted Audrey Jonas because she works for the county too and Iâm like maybe thatâs her department
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer set the nickname for Anthony Siraguse to Deborah Johnigan Protector.
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer set the nickname for Anthony Siraguse to Debra Johnigan Protector.
And her little picture looks like a sweet old grandma
I mean this ladies whole life is in here I couldn't just leave it with CTA
You are an angel
Oh yeah
I'm trying to be a good little citizen  because I've lost my wallet on the bus before and someone got it back to me
"She has like a bank envelope in here with like a LOT of cash in it and then a bunch of other lose cash, her checkbook, important other cards"
It's been like 3 hours
And annoyed that I have to lug around this very large purse
But she still hasn't wrote back yet and now I'm a little worried
So I had mary use her connections to find someone who works at the county who got us her email and we contacted her
She's a 70 year old lady who lives on the Southside and works for the county
It's a huge purse with a bunch of money and important documents in it and stuff
My mom and I went to the museum this morning and we found a ladies purse on the red line

"On the summer solstice, the sun aligns perfectly with my rising moon and the pergola"
Too strong a word for Johnny stocks
"Listen, as soon anyone throws around the word annoying, I'm out!"
i never bought that it was johnâs bday no way he wouldnât have made us do some dumb shit for it
"Thatâs why he made pergola, for all the other sons of summer"
Thank god someone clarified I was about to send out a duel birthday wish as well. John doesnât have the personality of a winter birthday
WHAT
Did the birthday's curse do absolutely nothing?
Oh I'm sorry but it took you to Joey telling you?
Joey told me it was annoying that I did it
Ok guys I'm really sorry it's not my birthday
Happy bday Alex and John! I was trying to scare you in thinking I didnât careâ¦thatâs why I waited so long to send this
Me and Kari just got tix to go see nosferator at music box on 12/30 @645pm if folks wanna come

"Libraries are a great, underused public resource"

I think the brothers Karamazov would pair nicepy with brush your teeth please pop up book
If any of these work for ya and you're able to come thru and get out by 7ish or so you can use these
Am totally flexible
Do u know what time you'd come thru
I will not harm them or damage them nor are they at risk of that happening
Are you gonna potentially break them and secretly replace them all?
Iâm looking for books that in some way either sensical or nonsensical âpairâ commercially together
Are u looking for a specific book
Does anyone have a sizable collection of books I could rummage through tonight and borrow for a video ?
"""Concrete crumbles"" is actually the flavor all of your birthday cakes now"

Eric Sony and Hypnosis set the nickname for Johnbo Walter Stockwell to Birthday's Curse Haver Enjoyer.
Birthday's Curse
No matter how many times you've voted for him
No president can save you now John
it's immortalized in the constitution
John doomed to watch the first half of whiplash over and over for eternity
only the president has the power to say you don't have a birthday
But my Birthday's Curse can
that's only a power the president has
No you're right I cant
The curse of immortality
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
You no longer have a birthday
Due to Birthday's Curse
Not anymore
WTF
ON MY BIRTHDAY?!?!
I'm actually placing a birthday curse on John Stockwell
In light of the revelations that have come to light
I'll try that
Then think about it
Youâre supposed to watch it all the way through
"everything I knew about it prior to watching made me also think, ""this guy seems like a jerk"""
this guy's a jerk
and i keep turning it on and off
I'm watching whiplash for the first time
Dunno where you got that from
ð¤
The way John has actually stolen birthday valor
hell yeah
This is a photo of me showing a child my leg injury video
"Happy John and Alexâs birthday! Or, as I like to call it,  John and Alexâs birthday"
"""Are your ready to choose your city?"""
hahahaha
Aaron's gonna come back like this

Sorry I havenât been as active today during my normal adderrall hours
THC bomb in the beer tub >>>
there's a natural human urge to soak in a tub full of something that's not water
But still not sure of the benefits unless you had like an extremely misguided scheme to try to frame someone for drink driving or something
idc if it's good for me or not
I lowkey want it to be a bath full of beer
Ya it's not literally a bath full of beer I think it's like mostly like a hop water bath
don't worry about it
confused why beer would be good to soak in but iâm in
this sounds perffff
And the part where you actually take a bath in the beer/hop water is private for you and your partner
I think the only gendered part is the steam room? I can't remember if that's gendered but i think that's also optional
oh hell yeah ty!!
It's on Milwaukee
Piva I think?
Ya I did beer spa once I think it's p accommodating
got a 2nd round interview in thirty min ð¤
looking for the natural wine spa
you should ask one of them the only thing I remember is the phrase beer spa
beer spa??? iâm interested
can't remember what the deal with that is like
brook and annaleigh went to that beer spa one time
the only non naked spa is aire and itâs like 10000000 dollars
I was there on a heavy edible once and I thought everyone with a king spa shirt was working there like damn this place has a lot of employees
I like don't think anyone would be too weird on the dude side but I so get not risking it
They give you a uniform
the short king spa
we need a trans friendly spa
god dammit
yeah no clothes allowed in the baths parts
and u have to be naked right
You like king spa? Name every temperature they have.
I like the one where you  lie on a bunch of tiny wooden blocks
every temperature you can imagine
lol that's literally how I was gonna describe it
They have a bunch of rooms of various temperatures
what else can y do
everything else you can do co ed
the bath parts are the first thing you go through and those are gender separated
i asked before i know but i forget
or all naked gender separated
is king spa something u can do co ed
I celebrate the birthday of my friends who are landlords every day
Happy Birthday @Alex Berr and @Johnbo Walter Stockwell!

Also go to this place
Calling the police in 90 second intervals to ensure you will not get inside
Just don't want you seeing when I prank your home
Thanks man
What were your thoughts on this
"Good, don't set any cameras up"
I think if I set up a camera it would be weird for her and also I would get sad if he was meowy or sad looking
No I have a friend apartment sitting for me for Conan ðââ¬
Have an incredible time
Did you setup any cameras in your apartment?
What
Do me a favor when you get there
10am
What time are you leaving?
Canât suck own dick with it tho :(
Got an inflatable headrest for my flight
@Anthony Siraguse was my fart epic?
Just gets me riled up
Something about national policy positions
I feel like that's a strategy to get you to ask as few questions as possible and just give her what she wants
"I'm on the phone with a lady who was like ""what can I do for the mattress cover? My daughter's a big bleeder in her sleep. You know the morning gush."""
Still gotta Chris proof my back gate
I've Chris proofed my garage
Hahahahahahaha
Nvm donât wanna jinx it
have the best trip buddy @Aaron Klopfer
It was epic
Ty everyone who came to my Japan party
Damn ainât no way Chris Trani is getting in there
Whatâs your code again
Thatâs sick
My garage now has a key pad that works with the same system as the front gate
Amazing news
"Alright I'm about to head over, do you want me to bring anything @Aaron Klopfer"
And don't forget everything I taught you about japan
Hope you have a beautiful trip
Sorry matey don't think I'm gonna be able to make it out tonight
"Scratch that traffic is ass, 40 mins from now @everyone"
@everyone 30 mins from home if anyone wants to come before 7 ð¯ðµ
Bills/49ers should do the trick
Iâll put on Italian cinema so you donât get over stimulated
I think I can make it to this ð
"I've heard of reaching across the aisle but a REACH AROUND the aisle????????? Folks,"
"Might be more like 6:30

Might be more like 6:30
Some zionist type shit
One time he made a weird comment to a Muslim woman after her set at Logan Lounge
Yeah he kinda sucks
He got dropped as a producer on a suburbs show and got so mad he said he âknew some guys that could care herâ
Ok boomer
Iâll be back by 7
"I forgot I had to work at the wolves game until like 6:30, please still come by at 7:15 if you can for a hang tonight.

So bummed I agreed to work today :( @everyone"
And then try to watch South Park with her
I'm going to ask her if she's seen the matrix
Hereâs how you take it to the next level dude
Movies and Music and Family stuff
What did you guys talk about
Your ass isn't even on the forums!!
His wife left him for a fan
We are hanging out again today
Really good ngl
Shank how did your date go
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
You could have taught him so much
I could have stopped all this
He could have been my student
Yeah and Shankland is pissed because Fuentes is his hero
But also destiny is married and has a kid so there's more drama there
Destiny is a popular streamer and debate bro who is a liberal and Nick Fuentes is an out and out neo-nazi
What Iâm getting is thereâs a gay sex video and itâs pissing Andrew the F off
Idk what these words mean
Just a reminder to call and check on your friends like me they're going through a lot rn
I HAVE SO MUCH FAITH IN YOUR RESILIENCE RICHIE I'LL BET YOU DID SOMETHING SOOOO COOL INSTEAD
You literally said that
"âCancel your movie night Richie, Rebecca and I are going to be out all night!â"
I would go
We got A LOT done
Richie we had a VERY punctual night
WE HUNG THERE FOR AN HOUR!!!
OK SHUT THE FUCK UP

Iâd assume you would be at Le Bouchon
the charleston?
hey where should we all go for me and dannyâs anniversary next week
What a night
After a 5pm dinner
Can someone start a rumor about me please
Stockwell was at Charleston from 7:30-8
Was there a Charleston hang? I got a bunch of thirsty madison boys here
Having a beer at da lodge nvm
Where are you folks
In one minute
We're chillin still
How soon you gonna be here?
CAM IM SORRY IT WASNT CLEAR IF YOU WERE COMING OR NOT
But you brought the demons out of me
Normally i'd be a sucker for an anecdote about your family going to a play
Wait no I want to hear about Annie
Stop trying to distract from how you just tricked me into going to a bar with your anecdote
"Rebecca also went to Annie today with my mom, sister and niece lol"
You're ok king
Oh god what i get my self into
Ilona is such a massive flip flopper it's driving us nuts
It's me Rebecca and her friend ilona lmao
I'll give you a ride there
I can go hang at lodge instead tho
Like 10min away in uber
Are you on your way???
Wait lmao are you here
"You know, eat dinner and go out after and be home by 8"
Does anyone else want to hang out at charleston
Shit
Oh well
Pretty soon
We rolling
Come bitch

Fuck im sorry @Meg Mc fuck
When are you going there @johncrete
Heâs starting to sweat
No one say anything
Hahahahaha I'm sorry
Come hang
LONELY ASS MF
Hahahahaha
Felt funnier to imply your loneliness
Yeah I was gonna be more direct
I feel like you went through a few ideas before you got to this one
You eat dinner at 5pm?
Maybe your landlord can do one with u????
It's what you do when you have anniversary dinners
"You know, universal dinner time?"
"5, actually, dinner time?"
Did you guys have your anniversary dinner at 4pm?
Doing social media pics for da adopt ah dog night at da wolves
LOVE the charleston
Nevermind we're going to the Charleston
We're gonna come grab a drink at Whirlaway for a bit
I'd be down @johncrete lmk
I could be down for a good old fashioned bar hang
Or something nearby idk
We might head to a bar in andersonville
I thought Rebecca would wanna chill on going out tonight after dinner but we're at Sun Wah and she's talking about hanging later
Anyone going to any bars tonight?
The astronomical odds of having a pleasant interaction with noshod a few times
Literally goes youâve been nice to me
Also Marcos Lara response is funny
(i.e. comics)
Pat for the course named the group The Lower World.
Drake suing umg
Organize.
No idea why he thinks talking to Cole will fix it
Basil was canceled fully out of the whole scene btw
"Guy Glitterus â¦ âGlitterusâ , if you will"
Chicago needs a mic for men ð«¡ð«¡

Heart react to this
For whoeverâs going to doves luncheonette if I get there first how many seats should I get?
Should I do MacGruber tonight or push what do yall think??
He tucked himself in
I think he would be funnier if he smiled more
Reminds me of my favorite New Yorker satirist Tom Skewer
John with the first share on the video!
His captors are making him do these
So in that way hats off
It is about the same quality of about 60% of weekend update tbh
It drives me nuts how he's pronouncing legionnaires disease
WERE BACK!
https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCXxhfPg8jQ/?igsh=MWhrZ3VoaWZ0Z3NuZQ==
But goddamn
Don't
That'd be such a dunk comment
Goddamn lmao
Should have mentioned it when we were dunking on him earlier
Just remembered Jame Najar brought his gf to coles on Valentines day last year lmao
Over the garden wall is pro cop
Just walked past a house that had a thin blue line flag and they were watching over the garden wall on their big ass tv
I've been waiting for the right occasion
I'm debuting my nuggets crew neck that Mary got me for my birthday
ð¤¤
UGH fuck that I'm in my pajamies
iâm three minutes away
SIMONES
Where is EVERYONE GOING
Malfoy and Hermione become lovers
Ok screw it I'm headed up there now too
Rebecca and ilona are in bed reading a Harry Potter fan fic where everyone dies and all the women get handmaids tailed
iâm almost there!
Who is Simon
I'm married to the idea of having glÃ¶gg
Well I'm going to Simon's either way so hopefully I'll see y'all there
balding
Wait why isn't Tony getting his hair cut
yeah iâll head now if people are still hanging
"Yeah I thought I was gonna get off work a bit earlier, walking home now. If you guys are hanging for a bit longer I'll take an Uber down maybe"
Homewreckers
Or are you basically Dunne
Are y'all still hanging for a bit
More malls in Chicago!
It's really such a wonder
heâs the first line of defense in the war on christmas ð«¡
That Mickey Mouse goes hard
I love the mall
On my way to Simonâs
iâm the most attractive person here btw itâs awesome
ð
and thereâs a group of moms in the front doing âmEEEOWsâ at danny
iâm at the metro for phylzzzz opening for a band called chevy metal
I liked black ops 1 ð¤·ââï¸
It has more sequels than fast and furious
They keep making calls of duty lol
No it still hits
Is call of duty an outdated video game reference now?
I heard they hack credit cards there
Yeah Simonâs tavern glÃ¶gg glÃ¶gg
In Andersonville
Weâre doing Simonâs instead
They got a fried bologna sandwich on there
Dang how late do they serve food
Dis one?
They have glÃ¶gg :)
Oh shit I've always wanted an excuse to go there
Change of plan going to Simonâs tavern 9pm
It says 2025 but I think they mean tonight
Going to carolâs around 9pm come hang
"I went a few months ago, tbh kind of underwhelmed"
I'm going to the Wayfair store
iâll buy u a beerâ¤ï¸
can someone meet me there at 4 pm to take a pic of me fake puking for a show promo
speaking of how coleâs is 9/11
And we will NOT be bullied into having the biggest hack category taken away
The Gay-Ellieâs
We should host a chat award show
He once lectured me on how Coleâs is âbumper bowlingâ for people who want to get Broad City back in the air
With great crowds
Like bombed hard
Hahahahaha he has been there so many times and bombed every time
Could make an argument that heâs the worst comedian in Chicago
Comedy Gazelle shouldnât have taken James Najjar winning biggest hack back
Iâve seen James. He was bad
Iâve never seen Bob Keen go to Coles
block party on kms avenue tonight
I canât believe James Najjar went with a 9/11 joke in the comments
yeah those were mean!
Can Bob and James be banned too
Itâs so hard to find parking on kms avenue
Banning from doing comedy could be seen as a blessing
Literally every woman has a bad story about him
"He sucks kristi, donât let him get you down. Heâs so disingenuous with why he was banned"
Since he claimed he got hacked bots have been responding to him
You handled it really well and you deserved more support earlier on
Iâm sorry you had to deal with this
even when deserved
itâs better this way but i will say banning people feels bad
Every single week he does something worthy of being banished
Even without being a creep he bullied an autistic man
Itâs the comedy version of an incel
god iâm gonna miss the way he brought energy into the room at all these shows
It was my greatest trick yet
Heeee showed up wasted and said some really rude shit
He shows up when you need him the most
i love that on kms avenue week for kristi noshod hopped in to play
At least he will learn and grow from without a doubt
and when i described everything to dustin and morgan they were like u know u can ban people right
he also grabbed the sign up list from me aggressively
Yeah Joey instigated by assuming the best out of people
So he had to be weird
You put him around women
Yeah he was setup to be weird
u guys set me up to be weird at crushes haahahah
he was like
when i told him i wasnât gonna bump him bc he makes my friends feel weird
Little did he know his email in bio could also be used for unbookingd
"Dustin, welcome to the resistance ð«¡"
I am Jewish in response to my unsend
i talked to dustin and morganâs about like WVERYTHING with him
i didnât even try to ban him
Can we get a behind the scenes Kristi
iâm sure itâs a very busy email box happy he saw it
his bio says âemail for bookingsâ
itâs in his bio
Ummmmm worst parent ever!!!?!??!
hahahahahaha
Iâd take a humper over a sitter any day
It's for humping
It's not even what the stool is for
To think you have that kind of hold over the room
If your legs are tired just lean against the wall
Truly the gall of an open micer who sits down during their set
It's offensive to think you get to sit down
Ban all stool sitters
How did coles get his email address?
oy
"Can u guys send me your favorite Spotify playlists ð¥¹ 

Iâm back on it"
Only thing I run to is the polls
Of all the scams you run you're gonna pay full price for software smh
Letâs all be media editing pilled
Adobe is half off for a year rn
Jesus Christ

Watching a Jan 6 doc and there's a guy that thinks getting everyone to smoke weed with him in the rotunda stopped everyone from turning violent lol
I bet it feels so good to lay down on an empty room carpet

Thatâs awesome
Camâs feet and ham
How was the chat thanksgiving did you guys have a nice time?
they were just mad we werenât playing divorced-at-24 tik tok country music
we were playing country music!!!
went to a strip mall bar that had a sign that said âthe country side of Columbusâ in the window and took over the touch tunes and the waiter came over and told us âyall are playing some interesting music tonightâ
If anyone wants dessert hereâs camâs feet

Bros just coming thru
and he was like iâm doing the mic
i was like dad please donât come iâll be busy and itâll be weird
Ugh that is a lot to handle but also kind of sweet that heâs using the mic to check in
and he wonât stop coming to hangouts
(bc i said i was gonna kms a few days ago)
my dad thinks iâm gonna kms
jesus christ
Yeah I think if we did it later at like 830 or 9 we could do a screening Sat nite
*Thegreatgatsbyshow
But does anyone know thegreatgataby show on IG? Ive asked him to confirm whether im on saturday like 4 times and he keeps telling me im booked for other things but not responding when i ask stuff
I think i have a show
Lemme get back to ya
Think Iâd be down
I also know cam will want to watch and I think he works until 7 but I havenât confirmed
Tbh you were the impetus for wanting to screen since you havenât seen so basically you can pick the time
I got stuff I gotta do but if I can make it work and it were late enough I'd be game
What time were you thinking
Okay I asked the other day but it might have gotten buried. Would Saturday work for a MacGruber screening for anyone? Or should I try a different day
True thank you
He probably thought it was funny
I feel kinda guilty. Whats the best way to feel better about this?
Anthony Jeselnik saw my story where I said he looks like a pedophile

"I went on a date on Sunday and the girl was like ""how is hinge different in Chicago?"" And I was like ""uh....there's not as many people"""
"Yeah Shank Iâll send you $20 to say âif youâre looking to fuck with someone, look no further than the Shankmanâ"
Sounds like it's your time to swoop in.
And then everyone else was like trying to get in on the conversation
"This one woman was like ""if nobody else going to fuck with me then I'm going to keep fucking with my ex"""
What stuff
Real Teachers of New York
That's sick
All my coworkers are talking about fucking and stuff
Going solo so just trying to socialize before my main interactions are with tourists
Is this small bar?
bro came thru
Trump is sending in the national guard
Thereâs literally ten of them now
"Fold two shirts, 2 pants, and 2 socks blindfolded!"
Yeah see if they're cut out for the laundry corps
Hahahahaha
Itâll remind them of the recruiter who first tricked them
Iâm gonna set up a pull-up bar for them they love that kind of shit
Thank them for their service
Does Uncle Sam not have in unit?
Yo how come there are three troops at my laundromat rn?
"Iâm so excited (not actually mad, just fun to mess with her)"
Also! Olivia had my umbrella I lost with my companies old logo on it so Iâm going to give her so much shit haha
Not too bad! Only on one crutch today so I can hold an umbrella!

A worker I always talk to at target asked if I knew Kristi Durkin lol
Feeling feral
Bad month
Serves you right for messing with John
Cam and I were definitely overcharged last night
How is everyone doing?
It's an interesting take on a quality piece of media
"Honestly, it's not bad so far"
Please keep me posted what you think of the show i wish i had more people to talk to about it!
I didn't come out to hang
I went home
Yeah I'm not their either
You have to keep watching my gat vampire show
No everybody went home
Are you guys still at small bar
But skeptically
I'll continue watching
There's something VERY fishy about this
Stop being so charming
Manipulative and charming
I wish he didnât do that because a show rec from cam is usually great but rn itâs a prank probably
This is all very Lestat of you
This is what he said he was going to say while laughing about you falling for his stuff
Richie... i dont like joking around about this because nobody ever follows through on my show recs and the fact that john is watching this means so much to me
I was like âthatâs not niceâ but cam kept saying âI donât care about Johnâs time!!!! Iâm evil!â
At small bar cam was laughing so hard saying âJohn is going to be watching this bi show but itâs actually very averageâ
Its just such an incredible show
Lestat is very bi but also very abusive
@johncrete  im sorry if i promised more bi
Ok there has been ONE bi interaction so far among many gay interactions in interview with a vampire
Yes!
Are people still at Small Bar??
It's not like a traditional place by any means but just v solid and nice and not too expensive
We've only been once but Saba on Milwaukee
You know what's kinda slept on that's solid
These also look excellent!
yes!!
I like segnatore in humboldt. Thereâs also this spot called void in Avondale that just opened that I wanna check out.
Is it quiet enough to converse comfortably??
im there rn!!
Had no idea this existed next to Andros! Great suggestion
Looking it up rn!
mano o mano!
Give my love to KPD Iâm catching up w old friends tn
"Speaking of, does anyone know of a good Italian restaurant in the Logan-Wicker-Bucktown area or adjacent that is quiet and not super scene-y but decent and not $$$? like Buona Terra in Logan before it closed?"

Good cheese curds too

They have food right
Also lil reminder that we're doing a lil hang for Kari's bday tonight at small bar at 9pm if anyone is free and wants to come out and celebrate
Not sure but they really make it seem if you are probably ATF then you must hate or want to destroy dogs

Illinois SOS answered at 31 minutes

We need a de-huh-drator for the chat when John posts
I will restrict your access to the venue of the future
Freeze until Christmas Eve
Actually it makes jerky
We need a deli insider
THIS!!!!!
Actually just start working at the deli again
You know perfectly well how much sense it makes
Lol Ian beat me to it
Hmm
Huh?
"Dehydrator? What does it do, send the meat to Humboldt at 10am?"
Yeah screw the grinder get yourself a dehydrator
Jerky
Of all the meats Iâve had venison is by far one of them
"Let Kerry get the meat grinder then she can grind all our meats for us too, dumbass!"
I had to do a double take
"Pat for the course voted for ""Yes"" in the poll."
Do you have to put it in a condom or could you put it in other things
great mis en place for sausage making
All is well
Look at the peace and order in this photo
I love stock photos
"the lil beekeeper's son voted for ""Yes"" in the poll."
apple martin created a poll: Should I host MacGruber screen...
This is a beanbag lmao
"I remember the time Rebecca bought a ""moon chair"" for $300 during the pandemic"
I think Kerry should get the meat grinder but idk I guess I just listen to women???
ð
"See, I'm just here to back up Chet"
No no no no no! You can just get them to do it for free!
look at this beauty
also I used to work at a meat counter and we had to clean the grinder between each different meat so if someone came in with deer meat to grind Iâd be kind of annoyed lol
you donât understand I want to buy the meat grinder
No need to buy a meat grinder!!!!
If you ask the meat counter at the deli I think they'll do it for you!
I was thinking shepherds pie bc thatâs the only way Iâve had venison before but also it means I would have an excuse to buy the meat grinder attachment for my stand mixer lol
what should I do with it?
It's so good
Deer meat rocks
was given fresh deer meat at the polka night afters

What time are you guys going?

Hahahahahahahaha
"Basically itâs Ian with The Rock and JK Simmons, but donât call him a boner"

@Adam McShane showed me the pic
Im sorry
Whaaat that seemed like a big show

so sad i missed wicked to do a show at the den that got cancelled
Wicked ripped
We ran into these guys!!!
Iâm pretty sure bill gevirtz showed it to me
Itâs like Iâm the only one getting those Pedro pascal TikToks

You guys donât let me flop on this itâs too embarrassing
I should emphasize I only want to go with people that are also going to be horny for all the actors in it
Giantspeak be like
Like crazy she's making significantly less
This woman is a para professional but basically foes the same job as me
But ya idk that was my big takeaway I'm left thinking about is how could we make here more like over there
That's not to say we as a people don't also have a greater culture where we treat teachers and service industry and retail like shit
That was the biggest takeaway from Japan for me is how blatantly better off everyone seemed to be there and how that highlights just how bad and worse people are treated here
Yeah man it's really wretched
Like how sad someone that also works at a public school has a second job :(
*from a woman
I just bought fries at Popeyes from I work with. I've never felt worse about this country
Unfortunately i cannot see g2 tomorrow
You can really tell i watched a youtube video
Like all the memorable lines everybody knows
Did you know for gladiator 1 the script sucked so most of the movie is stuff they came up with while filming on set
Maybe tomorrow? Or literally whenever Iâm not leaving town this week!

So you could really have a fine time at the cinema w our friends

Bruce!!!!!!
I'm gonna look up the plot on wickedpedia ð¤£ð¤£
And what better way to get informed than by watching the first half of the prequel to the movie
Itâs possible that the only reason that you donât like the wizard of Oz is because you only know half the story
Assuming Ian and kari are 5-6? Or we'll make some new friends
I hate musicals and the wizard of oz do you think Iâll like this movie
Cool got M7-8
Yep!

Hearing your upstairs neighbor fuck after a breakup is not a fun experience.
"Thanks for letting us know about things being fucked, we care and shit"
You are very easy to interact with
Overwhelming and unnecessary ð¢
iâve just had so much conflict this last month it really broke me tbh!!!
i think heâs always been bad but itâs gotten exponentially worse and i tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and was real with him and he freaked out on me
So glad to hear this
I would have the same reaction
"just took
a second for me to come forward with because i used to be friends w him tbh and it just made me anxious and sad"
victoria had my back and so did the bar!
Too tired for this

This is very unusual
Ok now it sounds like I think they normally get a Japanese audience
I've never been more upset after a good set
"And i feel a deep loss that, had i known that, it would have been the best set of my life to adult play with that"
But also i only learned afterwards that a lot of japanese people were using google translate on their phones to understand the sets
It was so fun
Love it when that happens
"Laugh Factory had a Japanese audience tonight, huh?"
how did the set go
The japanese people adore me

You could try reaching out to Sophie Biddle? Not sure if that would also put u in a don't shoot the messenger type situation
Fuck Brian hicks and fuck zanies and fuck Fiji water
ugh that sucks dude iâm so sorry
I was even nervous to post it in the chat honestly
like yeah he probably wouldnât even get a slap on the wrist
i wonder what would even happen if u just like posted that DM online
no literally
I know and itâs that shitty thing where Iâm kind of ashamed of myself for letting it happen but also I donât want to kneecap myself for nothing
i get keepin chill for ur career it just sUCKS thatâs such an annoying dm
ugh i know ur right im just like god damn i wish they would get put on blast
Heâs in charge
or a random
is brian the guy in charge there
But like what would change? Who would care? Iâd just get blacklisted there
Also he couldâve just said âwe already booked a hostâ he didnât have to explain that itâs because youâre a woman
idk megan i feel like you could literally put him on blast rn
"""I'm fat as hell!!!"" ð"
He's so likeable women relate to him too
"Peyton is really kind of an everywoman, not just an everyman"
is brian the booker guy
wait nvm zanies
what venue is this
oh my god hahaha
He had Peyton Ruddy host for Steph Tolev last year
â¦it was me
I am certain the man he chose will be wildly out of place and not vibe with the crowd at all
"He wanted to make sure we knew, this is Trump's America now"
Why not just say you already have a host
"Yeah there's literally nothing you could say that wouldn't just cement his decision, that sucks"
Hahahahahahahahaha
This is for Sophie Biddle. I donât think her fans are begging for male voices
Watching the crowd slowly get confused and angry when they realize they donât get to hear a man speak for once
You know what women love? Slumber party vibes
So I canât âmake a sceneâ
"What is this, a woman themed show?"
"And Iâm such a shill I just gave a thumbs up because tragically, I do still want to work there"
The human mind simply cannot comprehend three women on a show
And the male feature that was booked simply *didnât show up*
Had to watch Ralphie Roberts do a set about trying to get laid and also being married for 25 years
"Also explains why I only ever host for male headliners who, guess what, donât really care for my vibe!"
Iâm gonna burn that place to the ground what the hell
I want to just send this in response
"There are all-male host, feature, headliner shows all of the time"
INSANE reasoning
????????????????

@Richie Owens do any scenes in movies come to mind for violent muggings
Oh hmm
Just 2 blue line stops
No the one on belmont/kedzie
The one across from target got closed?
And I always felt kinda judged there idk
They got bought by LA fitness and closed the most convenient location for me so that was the last straw
Yeah it sucks it's gross
Xport
Didn't like the other place?
Renewed my planet fitness membership

Horse rug chat
We were so close to all having horse rugs
"Yeah, but he could never best the might of American industry"
This was when medieval Europe was mad weak and stretched thin
He got to the borders
Dude ghengis khan was about to take over Europe but then he died
China really slaps them around these days
Chet hanks favorite country is âMongolia
(don't tell anyone I told you)
It's actually where Gehghis Kahn is buried
I see nothing wrong with what Joey said
"Yeah, so at least 20% of people"
I wish the pergola did more to celebrate the Mongolian empire
The horse rug will be my pergola
My current rug got ruined ð¡
Itâs less flooded but theyâre still working on it
that depends on if your apartment is still flooded
Do you guys think I should buy this horse rug
Iâm sitting next to a lady at a coffee shop whoâs trying to sell a Tesla over the phone
@Aaron Klopfer We have not!
"I would never purchase a woman. They are people and not property, Aaron"
Women are 85% of all purchases
@Cameron Gillette did you and da girl text yet? ð¥¹
Pickme lotion ð¤
jr bacon CEO
Lotion for men for women is such a good idea
women are at least 20% of the market
I have been toying with this concept: what if we also sold products to women?
If you don't have a result it's bc you're still searching for the best way that something can be done
Saying that you want to search or investigate is great bc it sounds smart but it never promises and end result
Layout a plan for a rival and better company
and everyone can take turns being gay or straight
In five years I hope they'll have figured out conversion therapy
You should say you want to investigate ways to innovate the way your job is done
ooh I love that
no I leave the lotion sales to more qualified people I just help the guys who already bought the lotion
"In five years, you see yourself settling down with a wife and kids. You hope to have climbed the ladder enough to provide a comfortable, suburban living for your wife and beautiful daughter"
What is ur job? Lotion salesman?
Yeah 5 year plans are bs you just gotta find a way to write some goals that dont make it seem like you a promising to do more or deliver higher quality work
Aspirational but non threatening
this reminds of the religion classes I had to take in grade school
Say you wanna be CEO jr
what's the kind of five year plan that the world's dumbest ceo might like to see
catalina wine mixer sent an attachment.
Com Ed sent me an email that our power is off till 1pm ð¥²

Ijust submitted to be on my strange addiction

@Caroline Twyman @Johnbo Walter Stockwell
i was gonna make a joke about speed but you beat me to it. guess they call that slow joking ð¤£
I sorta mightve! It was more fun than i thought it would be!
Did you meet anyone??
Who was the fastest
Very fun speed dating night with klopf
I had to explain to everyone at speed dating that i wrote straightish because i wouldnt go to a thing like that to meet men
Some people drove three hours to do 2 minutes
So today there were 37 comics and everyone got 2 minutes
The mic in Charlottesville does this crazy thing where instead of capping sign ups they adjust the amount of time everyone gets
Put him in here
And found out he works at the winery Iâm starting work at on Wednesday ðð
Just got unsolicited advice from an unfunny dude at an open mic ð
We both cumâd
Me and cam went speed dating
that place was special
thatâs how i feel about it
Frankly I can drive just fine as long as I donât get caught
Itâs only come up once in like 5 years for me
Ok thank you thatâs huge
The cycle continues
Lmao it was the previous tenant
when I was living there we actually did get a rock thrown through our window ð«¶
Rock window?
and not a door I can directly knock on
thereâs not a doorbell for that apartment
Ring door
Imo just go to old address in person
but like I literally sent a letter to my old address and tried getting in touch with my old landlord and have heard nothing so I think o have to just declare it lost/stolen
I tried to renew via the kiosk and they sent that one to the wrong address and I havenât been able to get in touch with the people who live there now and the woman at the dmv right now kept being like I canât issue you a new ID you need to go claim the ID because your identity is floating around and someone could take that ID and throw it in a crime scene then theyâd blame you for the crime
THE WORLD IS RUN BY LANDLORDS AND FOSSIL FUELS LIBS ðª
Chat thought they could just ride bikes the rest of their lives
Looooool
I am currently in drivers license bureaucracy hell right now so this is close to mind ð«¶
they release the appointments at 6:30am everyday so you have to wake up early to book
Might have been because PA doesn't make you take drivers ed
I had to take a written test when moved from PA to get an IL license
If you just have a state ID and not a license
Looooool you might have to do a road test
God I'm just imagining the child like falling off the foot thing and flailing around
That's so funny
Hahahahahaha
canât stop cracking up at this
Or I'm sure someone on reddit has had the same problem
Give a call and explain ur situation and ask what all will be needed from you
Ok yeah IDK how that all is gonna work out
What's the matter with you
U just have an IL ID?
Iâve never had a license in Illinois
I think u can do online if ur at the same address as your prior license
Personally it would be very convenient if I could just grab one next week
Politically i think driverâs test should be stringent bc we donât do enough to recognize that these things are death machines that cause millions of deaths every year
But everything online is just if youâre over 21 just show up and pay $30
I think they just check you're vision
I haven't had to do a road test since ever
I surrendered my Wisconsin license five years ago to get an IL ID so Iâm like wonât I have to do a road test again
I don't think it took me more than an hour overall besides traveling there and back but it's hard to say bc I also got lunch after
Show up with proof of residency and whatever else Id you need
Go to the one in Chinatown on a weekday before noon
I think when I converted to MN to Illinois I just walked up too
I had to renew mine bc of an address change and I just went
No
Do u have an il license already
Did you have to take tests?
All the Chicago places say no available appointments so Iâm like do I just walk in with all the ids like âlemme drive a carâ
Gotta use crypto forms and lib bucks to fill out your government freedom form
We're in the future now
Sorry boomer
"When we went home earlier this year, Rebecca's dad was annoyed that this government agency he was working with wouldn't take a physically mailed in form"
It's sick
Everything is like online now
Honestly navigating government bureaucracy has never felt easier
After I showed two forms or whatever
"I think you have to make an appt now, but when I did it I walked in and they were like here you go"
Yeah I have
Hey next Monday is Karis bday and she is having a lil get together at small bar at 9pm if anyone will be free and wanna meet up

Also only murders in the building is good sick day vibes
I Said it privately but bad sisters is very good
Just objectively not good jokes
It's tough when you know the jokes are bad
Man I couldn't last even like a minute in
They're all just so selfish and petty it rocks
it's literally what if West Wing was good
Sorkin could never
I like how only some of the characters are actually clever and most are just dumb
that was a huge relief
will update my veep journey
iâm so glad we figured out what iâm watching tho thanks guys
Some of the richard splett stuff of the funniest shit I've ever seen on tv
this is my new binge
I think the finale is my favorite tv episode
It's SOOOO good
Veep is so rewatchable bc I never remember all the mean little things they say so they always catch me by surprise
Jesus Christ this is from when I like just moved to Chicago
also girl ofc iâve seen salt lake city
Like it's fictionalized but it is based on somewhat real things that go on
"Penn State has literally been taken over by high rise buildings, it's insane"
i have a hard time watching boy shows
i just wanted something w a girl in it i think
Veep is so good
oh wait iâll watch veep
It's kind of like veep where you're like ok the people who run our lives really do live like this and do things like this
It's tough when it's rainy out
"See, I don't think you should. Contempt is a rocketship to the top"

It is good
Otherwise the only things I ever watch are star trek and sopranos lol
no i want something thatâs like Good
Real life Truman show
Great british bake off is good for turning off your brain too
Secret lives of Mormon wives also very good
Honestly if you want to just completely rot and binge something insane real housewives of salt lake is pretty wild if you can stomach it
joey*

u have to watch white lotus
Oh white lotus slaps
The contestant on Hulu
so that the next time I'm sick I can finally start white lotus or whatever

If you donât watch it Iâll kill myswlf
Detroiters is on Netflix now
I almost never watch the popular tv show of the time
Itâs a doc
Go on Hulu and watch the contestant

"Genius, God bless the library"

Those kids will look back in 20 years and be proud that they stood for something

Itâs pretty legal to make your employees do a bunch of weird stuff
he 100% voted for Trump
the day after the election he came into the office and sang 3 little birds to everyone
Neither of those are fair to ask
How is this even legal Iâm not trying to do a bit

Iâve just kinda learned how to skim
i donât get how people handle the machete chris responses i would kms
like iâve been avoiding ever asking to do  a show for 3 years now
i just donât have enough good mental health to submit to stuff in general hahaha
So even if u don't get booked right away it would get you in the process to get booked v quickly
Seems like he sends that as a default but then books those people before you know it
but i am gonna just bite the bullett and submit today
i am so scared to submit to paper machete bc idk if my brain can take a novel response to why itâs just not the right time for me
Yeah he keeps talking about it Iâm gonna ignore
Like that feels like something micropeens get off on
I honestly think he only responded because he wanted you to ask to see it
Yeah im gonna get called a micropenis hating bitch
When can we have a pergola party
"Itâll be like:
Hey 
Hey
I knew u were a bitch
Hey"
This is the kind of dude that will call you a bitch when you stop responding

I have a theory that my dick gonna merge in ur mouth
Only to start the cycle all over again
"I have a theory that group chats expand continuously until they merge into one, super massive group chat consuming all other groups chats and spinning wildly out of control until it disperses scattering it's members into incalculable other smaller groups chats"

Jack rocks
My king of kings
It was like âhey sick to see you!â And then kinda fizzled
i donât know what i did before this group chat
Andrew and I ran into Jack at a show here
Because he showed me a meme Jack made about Laughable News
Iâm guessing Ricardo too
I think Knute is in the Jack Allen one
Life is so beautiful. Everyone has their little group chats
Wait who is in that one
One time Jack Allen was telling me about his group chat and I was just like I canât imagine
A sit down with the five families
Thereâs probably like 8 group chats and Laughable News is getting posted in all of them
Yalta Confrence of Chicago comedy
You canât ban queer joy thatâs what I always say
thatâs for the queer chat

Sorry Iâve had 1 beer

Thatâs the clear 3rd
Iâve been saying basketball game

and then colin ungers chat also has the same people they shit talk
"What can I say, I love to bet on the ponies!"
yes we did go over all the same people we shit talk
Iâm in both chats and we make fun of the exact same people in both but the other one talks about gambling more
horrible ratio i had to send them an excel spreadsheet with all the women they could add in
Yeah what's the gender ratio in the main chat ð¤ð¤ð¤
That being said? Happy birthday to Mitchell ð
"And I love Hunter, but of course he wants an all male chat"
Youâre our Snowden
devastating
and hunter went to shanker âoh damn dude ur in THE MAIN chatâ
and shanker named off everyone in his
and i named off everyone in this one
was w hunter hirsch and max shanker last night and we were talking about our respective group chats
HAPPY BDAY MITCHELL
I'm sure they'll have the main fight going on on the first floor
Well how about if anyone wants to have a beer before Mitch's and watch some amateur boxing fights  they're welcome to come over around 7 and then we can carpool over to schubas around 8-830
Damn
That would be my guess! 4 fights that start at 7 pm. Not sure how long those first three will go but Iâve gotta assume at least an hour
Well that's gonna cut into our beautiful Mitchell time
10 eastern?
So the Tyson Paul fight probably wonât go on until like 10
Ya I wanna try to quick go to the gym before how about folks start showing up around 630ish
Of da Paul Tyson rounds
Could at least watch a couple rounds
If Jake Paul wins Iâm burning the pergola down
Also I think I can have a few folks over before Mitch's to watch the fight just react to this if you wanna come over before
It was nice seeing u at schubas I hope u have a great night
Yoo happy birthday Mitchell!!!
I just want to reiterate happy birthday @Mitchell Potts
Think like when SpongeBob faced off with King Neptune on cooking burgers but take out the spatulas and they're touching
Unfortunately I only know how to explain this competition in terms of hamburgers
I'm not sure
So itâs like Joey Chesnut vs Kobayashi but instead of hot dogs itâs punches?
Itâs gonna be a Dave chappelle special
Which I feel is a big get
It's actually on Netflix
Blood sports are always pulling that shit
Is the fight not pay per view?
Ya lemme circle back later I wanna run it by Kari otherwise we can meet at a bar or something
Your place
Wanna watch with your cats
Wait you prob miss your cats
Crowds suck tho
Johns place it is
It also might make sense to go to a bar close to schubas I feel like theyâll drag the fight out with preliminarily fights
Aaron's place is further from schubas than your place Ian
Lemme circle back closer to game time
Wicker
Where's ur place with respect to schubas
We can also go to a bar or something nearby schubas thatâs playing it
My place or ur place @Ian Erickson
Share if u agree
Very disappointed
"I can't go to Mitchell's tonight though unfortunately, I'm going to a surprise party for Julia"
Maybe yeah
Oh maan
Anyone wanna pregame Mitch's and watch the Paul - Tyson fight
Thank you guys!
Happy birthday Mitchell!!!!
We love @Mitchie !!! Happy birthday @Mitchie !!!
Oh hell yeah. Canât wait to see everyone! Gonna be a fun night
Happy birthday mitchie! See ya at schubas!
Oh hell yeah
I canât wait to go to Schubas to celebrate with all my friends
Thank you!
Happy birfday @Mitchie
She's truly the best
canât believe iâve never seen her set until tn
kristen toomey is soooo nice
heâs the rookie of the year
I was doing so good not having to learn what the rizzler is and now it's he's become too much of a cultural force for me to ignore him. Hats off to the young man
Me in another life
Taylor swift can get a million likes. How about our celibate lads? ð«¡ðºð¸âªï¸âï¸
Housing office Sam seems to be settling into his routine ð
She didnât even like my joke
Weâve had to call the cops on her so many times haha
"Then she told me to be a man and stand on my own feet and I got to say âI canât, Iâm on crutchesâ"
"A tenant who is pretty insane that screams every time she comes into our office was like âthey canât fire you, why are you scared of them?â When I told her I wouldnât do something for her and I had to be like absolutely they can??"
Is this you bruce?
Yeah was not a dig on the producers theyâre all great. Revival is just in a tourist-y part of town
"I thought revival was fun, also I like knutes demeanor running a show"
â¤ï¸
Also if anyoneâs office job is hiring I need to get away from Trader Joeâs while I get going on the internship
Tourists? They were a very tense crowd when I was there but Iâve heard other times itâs fine
whatâs the vibe
Yeah
Her eye literally twitching
The day after the election I looked miserable and a coworker asked  âWHAT SEASONAL PRODUCT ARE YOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT??!â
so major fuck trader joeâs
"Iâm at the point of wanting to cry at work, this is huge"
congrats buddy
yooooo!!!
Itâs probably gonna suck but itâs a good foot in the door
Just got an internship for social media content
anyone ever done the revival theater
Neighbor is icing me after his partner kept flirting with me
I replaced twitter with Blue sky and I replaced reddit with pokemon trading card game

Art dealer is my favorite character he's such a chode
You literally just did I'm only one episode in
"Nick, Garrett, Ramses, and Stephen are all chill"
So let's not spoil anything?
Ok I'm on episode 5?
The birth control stuff was wack
I feel like we're not talking about the same season
Yeah
RAMSES IS GHOULISH??????
this season had the most ghoulish men of all time
It's about love dipshit! Not people swinging!
what did you want it to be like Love is Blind: Habibi?
What the fuck are you TALKING ABOUT
This season had good draama
Skip

Are you guys gonna go to Coleâs? Trying to decide if itâs worth ubering/putting on real clothes
Give her her keys back

I'd add them to the group chat
The artist formerly known as?
has anyone heard of Tommy Schneeman
"hey fun group topic, if you told your boss âi hate waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night, this isnât fun anymore and i am broken.â what would you want your boss to reply with? how would you feel best supported ð"
Limes go left
Fixed it
ð¤
ð
Hmm good luck finding people willing to hang out with him
Hmm. So youâve just been ignoring all the articles Iâve been sending you then
Also some good news: my kid has all his vaccines now so he can hang more
Yep 9 cst

iâm brain dead on the whole scheduling interviews in diff time zones thing
i have a dumb question

Kristi are u hosting early or late Cole's
But I live to ball
I was born to plow ð
a solid boy with which to plow his fields
But dumb as dirt
"My neighbor's dad loved me because I was big, I was like Sam"
Never was me
Hahahahahahaha
she thought I was too annoying for that to be true
I still remember my friend's mom being audibly shocked when she found out I had the best grades in my class in middle school
His answering machine bit was crushing last night
Me and stock well keep doing the fresh faces show together
hahah man parents hated my ass as a kid
I miss that about being a kid
"I was telling John, parents always loved talking to me"
That's really good
Hahahah
"Just wanna shout out @johncrete's funny joke at LF last night, he went up after @Samy Dick and said ""give it up for Sam everybody, every dad's dream son"""
GET HER ASS!!!!
Pfhhhhh
wanna comment so badly i promise nobody stole that disaster girl

Anybody trying to see Heartbreak Kid at music box on Sunday?
The childâs name? Jim Davis III
The duality of 4th grade man
Before this it showed the author and said his hairline is cooked and he looks like he has autism
The cats favorite food is pasta
Kid I volunteer with drew me this
A kid got in trouble during a fire drill today because he kept screaming that he was being kidnapped and a woman across the street waiting for the bus started filming lol
so weirdly it was news?
it wasn't laughable but I genuinely did learn something from the Uranus video
Thanks Brian
I still need to watch that one
just him pronouncing Uranus. not a joke in sight
omg the last one he posted was so good
Does Laughable News count as a podcast?
The homeostasis award

Ian after returning from Japan
followed through on this
can we protest with FREE ZAKO signs>
I was GLUED to my phone
it was probably my fav day in the group chat
"Laugh all you want, before I die I'm getting an EGGOT"
i wanna go this year
Everyone is right though
And that was one of the funniest things Iâve ever seen
Iâll always have a soft spot for the Gazellies because it gave the world the Zako-Mack fight
i canât believe we have gun and gazelle also has fun
Itâs astonishing how many comedians cant understand joking
Sort of a âwho is this for?â Kinda thing
Gazelles are very similar to when a college theatre department does its own award show
maybe we will be ok
i did find out all of the people we shit talk in this group chat are also mentioned in another group chat
EXACTLY
"people always jump to the defense of jerry and the gazelle bc they're putting on good shows or whatever but it's like, can't a guy just make fun of someone for doing something dweeby anymore?"
yes
This would be so funny
Letâs give Blake burkhardt rookie of the year
Is there not a cunty award this year?
We can all put you for Most Improved
Or is that a bit that can only result in me having to go to the Gazellies
Should I campaign super hard for a Gazellie
ð
Ian's BACK????
"aaron ""59 likes"" klopfer set the nickname for Kristi Durkin to didn't mean to change name sry."
Japan was great but it's good to be home
"aaron ""59 likes"" klopfer set the nickname for Kristi Durkin to sasa."
Could we all hold hands there
I'm being sober and that sounds like the perfect environment
wait we should make a good form to attend a bender
hahahahHA
We could do a chat trip to go see them every single night
itâs kinda cool in the sense thatâs itâs like tour but every night u get to go home to ur gf kristi
I wouldn't do it unless it paid enough to take more than a month off
iâm likeâ¦. feeling happy but conflicted about it for him lol
no days off
Might genuinely cause an injury
It would definitely be kind of cool to get that many reps in but no breaks at all is nuts
Wait like no days off?
but itâs like thereâs never a Good month to do a show everyday i guess
the drama is that we were gonna go on a family trip and i was gonna film my special the month they asked
hAHAHA
wait i just got booked on some barstool show
Honestly could be an incredible creative process
Yeah there is no parking or bike parking over there. That is an insane offer in general. Liars Club is the new Vegas
That feels like durational performance art
and i donât fuck w the regulars but i do like the venue
It's really in a fucked up random part of Fullerton there's like nothing around it for two blocks
they have weird regulars
"itâs like,,, i like it but im like jesus everyday at liars club sounds like a lot"
Man I've always wanted to see what that place is like on the inside I've gone by it so many times
itâs ALWAYS like that
lol phylyzzz just got asked to do a month long residency for liars club where they would play everyday for 30 days
Couldn't find my cat for like 10 mins and was frantically searching around having a minor panic attack and then when I finally found her under the couch she was looking at me like this
EXACTLY
I never hear of these guys until theyâre the most influential thing on the internet
also i think i donât realize how big he is bc i never really looked him up bc the vibe seemed off
idk i totally agree it sucks but im like god damn i have to book people every week and now i have assassinate kill tony?
a cumtown residency is a cumtown residency
Humiliating
Like imagine liking the president
Last thought is that they feed off of feeling like they're edgy and counter cultural but guess what trump won the popular vote that's your guy
if this is your attempt to get crushes to stop booking nick mullen it will not work
If you could go back in time would you kill baby Bob keen?
Exactly I'm saving their lives
What are you stopping them from doing? Most of the Kill Tony heads are dogshit at comedy and donât do anything besides the worst open mics imaginable
When actually it's so lame
I just think you run the risk of making it seem cool
The next Rogan will be Shanklandâs fault
I can't stop joe Rogan but I've met a lot of guys that I probably could have
"I just think about the open micers that are like ""oh I like kill tony"" and maybe I could have done a better job explaining why I think it's bad to them"
I think at a local level it's important to call out people when they buy into that shit and not fuck w them
I think you need to mock them more than anything
THANK YOU
I do think Bruce is right tho
"Yeah, and I think the new ones are going to be floating around the orbit if what already exists"
Those guys are too big to stop but there are new ones started every day
Obviously I'm thinking beyond what reality is right now but I'm trying to think what are the steps we can take
Because younger comedians aren't going to see these platforms as a route to success if using kill Tony as a credit can get you blacklisted
Instead we should say Joe Rogan makes a quarter million from Spotify and makes consequential presidential endorsements so he doesn't get to do the I'm just a stoner idiot don't listen to me act
I'm thinking live stand-up yeah
I mean yeah if you're talking live standup but that isn't really the problem imo
If clubs and producers stopped booking them
I think the approach is to treat them the way they treat mainstream press
What are you gonna exclude them from we're talking about the biggest podcasts in the world by far
Yeah itâs a real problem!!! Especially on twitter where people will retweet anything they hate to be like âthis is badâ and end up just giving people a bigger platform and help them gain an audience
They are the platforms
No we're past that point
Like people are always saying they suck but I think there probably needs to be more of an effort to not platform these kinds of people and the people that support them
And the Joe Rogans etc etc
I'm reading the antifa handbook and I'm starting to think maybe we aren't harsh enough when we talk about the kill Tony's and legions of skanks of the world
@johncrete what movie did you see
the way iâm so there
I love a beautiful birthday
exactly!
Itâs actually so important to remember that mitchell is having a bday party at schubas on this upcoming friday & weâre all invited

Whoa!

"does everyone know mitchell is having a bday party at schubas on this upcoming friday & youre all invited? ð 8-midnight, we rented the upstairs ð¤ "
yes.
You donât bring that up nearly enough
When I was Val Kilmerâs assistant he was doing a one man show and the other assistant had to be the audience plant for every show
Right now Nick Fuentes could be listening to boygenius and we'd all be at brunch
Shankland doing what Kanye couldnât
You could have instilled in him a love of music
Just audience plants
He graduated the year before I got there but I would have had him
Nick Fuentes was a student at the school I student taught at
He's been around he was on Kanye's campaign staff
And it turns out he lives in his mothers basement in berwyn
A far right dickhead made a video gloating about women losing rights
Has anyone seen the nick Fuentes stuff
Burn
My mom
Does anyone know about plants

Bail
"Dude yeah, fuck that"
"For how it is in general, i feel like it has the most touristy crowds out of the clubs"
Oof thats creepy
Theyâve asked me out line three times
Also honestly Iâm 99% sure the person that booked me only booked me because theyâre trying to sleep with me
I donât care if I bomb
I mean in the sense that management is awful
"Also, who knows, maybe it got better?"
You can't protect yourself from everything and still learn lessons
I say experience it and decide
I got booked on a show there tomorrow and Iâm trying to decide if I should bail
You guys how bad is comedy bar
You should it was an awesome idea
no worries
Anyone wanna go dancing Saturday btw??
Itâs such a fun kinda show to produce
"Hollywood, Illinois"
When I get back from Japan Iâm starting my video show again :-)
Truly she was slumming it at CrushXCrushWest
truly insane
I left a little after it bc was tired from driving but good vibes
Kinda insane how good Clareâs video was.
Suckân my own dick at midnight
it was starting to feel too much like lolla!!!
I think it's canceled because I don't think anything good is going to happen again
Just perfectly in the way
Those dumb vip booths wrecked the vibe
and also the lineup this year was lame
honestly pitchfork has gotten to be too much
In their reviews
Pitchfork is about to start using the r word
I just think that's an attempt to soften the blow
watch them move it to austin
yeah and saying âwe will not stop hosting eventsâ
I just feel like itâs so specifically like âweâre not doing it in Chicagoâ and âwe have made the difficult decision not to host Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicagoâ sounds like itâs gonna be somewhere else
Like I don't think moving it to Gary Indiana or whatever would make it more profitable
Yeah you're probably right
"I don't interpret that as ""we're going to have it somewhere else"""
I mean thereâs European pfk fests that are wayy smaller which is maybe what they mean by continue to produce events
Yeah itâs GQs faultâ¦ gays and queers!!!
"Whoa whoa whoa, letâs not go that far"
wait thatâs so gay
Man fuck GQ
Looks like it might just be moving cities which is DUMB
What!
Pitchfork fest done for good ð¢
and i just am like man maybe just close friends at lake house would be so sweetie
i feel like every year i try to either throw or go to a massive house party
FUCK ALL THEM THO
"usually we go to rebecca's parents, or my parents"
"I'll see what our plans are, but I also like this"
fine
i feel like halloween was so much shit and iâm like wait chill lakehouse holiday sounds soooo nice
anyone interested in going to wisconsin for nye?? staying at my dads vibes

My favorite part of eat pray love is when she spies on her neighbors
Klopfer you should buy a bunch of vape cartridges for 14/$100 and then resell them to your Trader Joeâs coworkers for $30 a pop

Truly one of the funniest things Iâve ever seen
Sam when you played soccer and fell only to somersault and spring back on your feet
iâm sure theyâre friends but it is truly so funny to hear geoff asmus get name dropped while iâm waiting on a line cook to drop a rueben
he keeps talking to the 25 year old food runner about âasmusâ
Hahahahahaha
hahahahaahahahahahahahaha
He played soccer with us once and he got a yellow card because he purposely slide tackled someone and in the 3 seasons Iâd played no one had even gotten carded
Hey Joey? I think this was a good riff that people didnât respect enough
"Gonna get him pregnant some day, God willing"
I love that bitch
She had been on my show like two weeks prior
One time in that side area at LF tiny was giving comics hugs next to me and I thought she said hi to me so I gave her a hug too and then she goes âare you a comic or something?â
I went to high school w a guy named Tiny Thickemz. Think heâs in real estate in West Allis now

new update he keeps making fun of tiny thickems for showing tit on stage
he wonât stop talking about laugh factory in front of all our 22 year old co workers who hate comedy
and heâs really nice but heâs embarrassing me so much
i work w collin under now
I'm out on basketball this weekend but i agree with klinger especially once it snows we should replace basketball with breakfast
I would attended a post-bball diner lunch
Folks were DUN
Last Saturday was too close to Halloween and Kristi birthday
But last Saturday I was one of three people
Everyone was talking about big game
Then it's basketball season
Is the court clear?
Ain't over til it snows
No
It's so nice out
Unfortunately it seems so
Is basketball season over
Would anyone be interested in a diner breakfast tomorrow
"I'm gonna have another Christmas party gang. Trying to decide on a date, heart this for 12/7 and thumbs up for 12/14"
And it's other funnier comedians
"If I've learned anything, it's that club owners know exactly what makes comedians funny"
LOL
CJ is popular on twitter and has some writing credits now I think
Cj is a good comic that used to live here
Jamie masada is the founder of laugh factory like above curtis
Why does anyone try to put their finger on the scale
"Also, I don't understand shit like this lol"
Who is Jamie Masada and CJ Toledano
"I guess its not great tea, but jamie masada really wants chris bader to be a thing"
"Way back in the day when cj toledano lived here, jamie masada tried to get cj to write jokes for chris"
A little tea i know about chris
Really?
I have never seen that dude show up for a spot. Heâs on so many posters and then just doesnât go
At least a once a week performer at LF
He's like the kind of dude laugh factory books CONSTANTLY
Me? Iâm more of a guy on 2 shows type of guy
Oh gotcha
"Kind of a laugh factory, Zanies, comedy bar and road guy"
"Iâve never heard of that guy, is he never? Or just like a laugh factory guy"
And he sucks so bad
Laugh Factory just throws him on everything
It's so funny that Chris Bader is on the fresh faces show me and Sam are doing next Tuesday

Okay I still havenât seen Anora so I think Iâm going to the 6:55 showing at Regal on western
I have a free laundry key so Iâm gonna wash everything I own this month for revenge
Didnât wanna stain the clothes
Dropped ten bucks on a laundromat bc of that little stinker
Right when I poured detergent on clothes
Landlord shut water off an hour earlier than he said he would for repairs

Whoâs going
Hell yeah!
i got the second interview!!
Communication is always good
To confirm the time?? I donât think youâve gotta
is it dumb to do a follow up 15 min before an interview
Kidding around here but pls dont let it get infectected
Do landlords know about neosporin? It's body stuff not building stuff
John this looks like you haven't put ointment on it at all
It's literally been like 4 days
It's really wild how this cut is progressing
Kilometer Tony?????
Getting word of a possible special guest at Coleâs next weekâ¦. Heâd be traveling a lot of â¦.. KILOMETERS to get there
UGH MAKE LANDLORDS GREAT AGAIN
heâs Marxist now â¤ï¸
Trump is gonna make it illegal to be mean to landlords
What I'm really worried about too with trump being elected is that mortgage rates will go up and I won't be able to refinance by May like I wanted
The cost of shit has being going up a lot
I may even have to increase rent if I can't refinance this year
Honestly probs not
danny and i wanna make a house a home

But I know it's there to heal me
"Man, pulling a scab off is so satisfying"
Might try yoga w Adrienne now this bitch sounds cool
thats why she had to learn yoga! to stretch!
HOW DID THEY EVEN KISS????
THATS TOO TALL TO LOVE!!!!
and she dated a guy 7 feet tall
til yoga with adrienne is an alcoholic who smokes
Nice!
heâs shooting his own short!
Plester?
and i had to be like hey thatâs sick but i want actual good footage girl what r u doin
my producer is like cool but too cool and thinks we can film this on only a camcorder
iâm scared
hahahaahhaahahah
I thiiiiink I know how heâll film itâ¦begrudgingly ð
ooooo good idea
"Tbh, Derek??"
on a handheld preferably
who would yall recommend for a person to film a show
he opened up his set last night being like i lost a bet if trump won i would have ti get into ventriloquism
The last time I saw him rap at Coleâs it made me laugh so hard
does anyone have his number
He fucking rules
itâs okay when i do it
Now that Kristi is the host I realize that itâs actually a very just system
I thought the bumping at Coleâs was so unfair when I first started here
heâs getting into ventriloquism
haahahHAH i love him so much
Erik West would get vouched so hard
Three months in youâre already addicted to this bs
what is coleâs if i canât let joey walk in and do a set
all i do is bump
Erik West can be the one guy you bump in
and itâs like no bumping??
thatâs so true
I think the 6pm crowd is probably exactly the group that is monitoring the vouch shows
hahaHAHA
how will erik west find out he doesnât have a computer
But the mic was a pretty decent vibe
Well the word would spread
idk!
yeah like is it fair to throw this new format in for the people who come every week at like 6 pm and wait
Didnât mean to send that
ð
"Yeah, I will say when I did the one at Lottieâs there werenât very many Coles regulars"
i donât want to screw over our regulars
yes but just coleâs style donât be a weirdo and change our format
maybe iâll tell them yet but no lotto
yeah also i donât want to do lotto
Yeah itâs a lotto of 50 people upton
And a different sign up process I guess since I think they do lotto
Itâll just be a different 50 open micers
itâs def not gonna like help coleâs
and yeah sometimes nights at coleâs are slow but idgaf itâs mainly 50 comics every week and a really long gig
no literally i get the same paycheck so idc
Frankly all youâre signing up for is a longer night of hosting. Youâre doing him the favor
but when my friends get it thatâs fun no shade
Yeah if itâs âwe need to now nowâ then the answer is no!
and gay even
but itâs coming off not cool
ultimately i think itâs a good idea for the scene
EXACTLY
CYSK speedrun
"Going in with that attitude of ""you should be honored to be asked and don't expect me to be organized or respectful of your time"" is just replicating the rotten culture"
Idk I can see the value in something like that conceptually but it only works if you have some humility
That makes it easy imo
and he was like well no itâs important i go home tonight with an answer
"but yeah, really up to you guys"
and i was like hey you never reached out to me i need a second
"I feel like honestly there's plenty of slow nights at coles anyway, so it wouldn't hurt to make one of em for vouch"
yes
Wait this was in person?
idc that much i donât like that he was like cornering me as i was trying to set up saying âhe needed to know Nowâ
i personally donât see it at coleâs but idc too much
Will doing it at coles just alienate the audience of normal attendees that already come on a regular basis?
does coles benefit?
"My only thought on them asking to do it at coles is, why coles?"
I think that's just the only way to present it
"Even if they're fuckin dorks about it being like ""an honor"" or some shit"
"Consider the way that organizations raise money for specific causes. People always make the argument of like, ""people will donate to the cause anyway"", but I think ultimately formalizing the process and stirring up publicity results in a more accountable experience, and forces the process of bookers booking people"
"i think the purpose to get people booked is genuinely good but this process is a little redundant and a jack off, no?"
to doâ¦ other shows?
and then the show is an audition?
So thatâs how it works logistically
I did one of the mics and basically they just draw 50 people at the beginning of the mic to do 3 minutes as an audition for the show
like why doesnât chris trani just come see an open mic and ask people himself
it seems a little self important???
I do think what they're doing is a genuinely positive move for the community though
he didnât like that i didnât know him
Brandon is a sloppy person
lol
and i was like ahhhh what hahaha
and heâs like âwell we need to know Nowâ
brandon was like hey victoria hasnât responded to me so i showed up where is she and i was like sheâs in madison
they asked to do coleâs and idk if i like their vibe
ok iâll bite whatâs the deal w vouch
i donât girl iâm sorry
upper penisula

CHAOS BRINGS THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER
Feeling amazing running into John stockwell tonight in the middle of the street in front of his house because somebody was drunk driving (?) and rammed their car into a bunch of cars on his street like 15 minutes before Derek and I biked by from a late showing of smile 2 where we got way too drunk and way too scared and thought we were still in the movie a little bit
Explain
yeah basically
howâs morale
not bad tbh
Is he the new moral center of Coleâs open mic? How are the vibes there
i like christian royce now
Kristi is saving the world rn
Yeah I immediately regretted that as soon as I sent it
and this is what I come back to?
I go to Japan for TWO WEEKS
Please Ian I know times are difficult but we canât blame Japanese beetlejuice
I can't help but feel Japanese Beatlejuice shoulders some blame here
When we needed you the most you went to Super Mario World
It's a shame America can't hear poopfucker tonight
Gonna figure out the joke that will fix America on the way
Gonna head up to Coleâs in a few
Are you in touch with IWW?
In a groupchat with workers who wanna unionize but our store hasnât yet
Is there a union person you can talk to
I donât know how to explain it itâs so convoluted and fucked
The hours I needed to go towards my ada/fmla thing were cut down because I was on leave of absence for injuries
Does this make sense?
"So I was enrolled also in an ada thing (did that so I couldnât get reprimanded for looking like Iâm not having fun at work.)

That gave me two call offs a month. Those absences go towards insurance hours.

I was banking on those to go towards my insurance qualification.

Theyâre just now telling me I havenât worked enough to qualify for that kind of thing so I canât account for those absences"
Idk how fmla works but getting injured and taking a little off seems pretty obvious and standard right?
Iâm ready
Need more incentive for a change
ugh dude iâm so sorry thatâs horrible
Losing my insurance in December bc I didnât work enough bc of my injuries :-)
Put a gun range in the pergola
"Shooting a gun is like being bisexual, you really need to try it every few years just to check and see if your taste has changed and you like it now"
Shankland is political enough that I'd consider going
Same
Fucked of you to say because I do have my rifle merit badge
bc you'd be the first guy we all turn against?
"Yeah, and I'd go with him!"
Aaronâs friend isnât in the chat to be fair
Absolutely going nowhere near a gun range with anyone in this chat
i've shot rifles with my dad before
I love shooting guns
Just honked at a coworker for trying to be cutesy with me while I sit in my car for my break
ð
He has a lot of guns and good vibes
He would be down
I have a buddy who is an ex marine
anyone going to this-
That man looks like he owned guns off the record as well
"Lmao Richie's real estate developer, good fella grandfather"
Can I use this
Just found my grandpaâs gun license
"Gun bad, gun range fun"
And when you hit the little can sitting on the fence? Oh baby
Shooting a gun feels awesome tbh
No dog hate the dog is innocent!
Also I used to work for West Virginias newest senator and I canât tell you how much I hate him and his dumbass dog
"chat trip to gun range 
ð¥¹ðð"
You simply gotta try it
Itâs crazy some people in this chat havenât shot a gun
If they donât pass they get sent to vibe camp
I would have a gun in a fun Charlieâs Angels kind of way
This country needs mandatory vibe checks
You pass the vibe check for one meg
idk I think Iâd be really good at gun
cant stop telling people about it
and unfortunatley it is the funniest thing ive ever read in my life
Some liberal white guy derek went to college with posted on facebook today that he wanted to learn how to shoot a gun because he was afraid for where the country was headed but a few weeks ago posted a 3 paragraph post about how being in las vegas was over stimulating
Good news! They're sending the kid that bit me to a farm upstate with lots of space to run around with all the other kids that bit their teachers
There is still good in the world chat
Hahahaha
You think the uBreakiFix guys stole it?
All my porn is gone tho
Got my phone fixed if you couldn't tell
There should be more imo
"My own Twitter, you might say"
there are 95 people why not use it as a testing ground
A medium of my own creation
"A writing exercise, perhaps"
This chat is simply a writing utility for my twisted little jokes
don't hide your light in the bushel of this chat
"In this one, rare, instance John and I agree"
Wanna host shit for dis cute little chat
We can also lip sync budd Dwyer etc
I have an amplified podium at my apartment if anyone wants to do a weird karaoke night
Coming from the chat heretic of course you'd say that
I had strep the first time he won and now a knee injury. Feels like this is my fault for not staying healthy
Nothing is sacred
I do this on almost a daily basis
"Lol yeah, weâll see, not sure yet!"
I feel like most folks are tuned out of everything right now
I say post it if you feel like it
"In a way, the same thing"
ð
I see you as the chat grocery store owner
Iâm sort of a chat organizer
Chat is kind of the new community
Oh well then that's fine of course
But I did then use it and for that I apologize
Haha i made it before I sent it to chat
Chat is sacred
"I don't like a chat joke getting posted, dangerous precedent"
Crisis averted
You know what? Maybe Iâll just not today
https://witschicago.org
"I think itâs funny, but I donât want to post it if itâll just bum people out, you know?"
Like would people be upset?
Is this ok to post?
"He kept me on track when I tried asking about his dog, he said âcan we read?â"
There was a picture of rulers and he called them ânerd technologyâ

MacGruber is all time
The series on peacock is good too
And love you very much @Anthony and everyone in this beautiful chat
Macgruber is one of my fav movies that not enough ppl have seen. We need @Ian back home to see it as well
I want to host a screening of MacGruber at my house soon if anybody is interested
RIP noam he never responded to my email
Chomsky changed me
Let me know how it is! I've never read kropotkin but I've become anarcho-curious
Felt like a bit of a rube paying for anarchist literature that is freely available online but wanted a nice physical copy to have and to hold

We're all we've got folks
"Sorry to be sincere but I love everyone in here. Even the ones I don't/barely know. Been kind of a recluse for the last year but our dumb little ""community"" has suddenly become very important for our collective survival and I would love to see your beautiful faces more in real life going forward"
he would sit on the stool for his host set and tell it how it is

They need to open an iO in Mississippi !!
Iâm just saying I can marry whoever wants it
Sorry I wouldnât move to Canada
my stupid take is we need to mass exodus to red states
I will say that we had bag milk in elementary school in the states
"Loving and strongly agreeing with this anti-move-to-Canada discourse, itâs my least favorite whim of grown men"
I picked an insane month to give up candy
should i delete
and dried goods
stockipiling assault rifles and fleshlights

im just thankful my kid can grow up in a dumbass country
southpark ass groupchat
They were sending indigenous kids to re-education camps and burying them in unmarked graves well into the 80s so I really don't wanna hear about Canada right now
It's a fucking mining company that calls itself a country
i kno they're mad racist and stupid too
I hate when canada acts all hoity toity in moments like this
the idf needs videographers
and they all want to move to canada
i told my gf that unfortunately the only foreign country we can legally move to rn is israel
brooo we already have gun
(i promise I won't until like my 50's or so don't worry)
i literally have suuuch a low tolerance for white people saying they want to move to canada now idk if i can handle it ahahaha

i have no cooridnation
i shouldn't even have a bicycle

i know man
The most important thing anybody can do today is not post a promo for a comedy show with âwe all need some laughsâ
going to be honest: dont get a gun
i been googling vasectomy and foid card stuff
My TikTok is full of women urging me to go 4b aka end dating so get your jokes out while you can
Thatâs the one thing I CAN promise right nowâ¤ï¸
"but Sam, what if in Trump's America dating will no longer be weird?"
Itâs our duty to talk about how dating is weird
I disagree. In this moment as comedians we HAVE to speak truth to power
Standup comedy seems pretty insane to do tonight but I also wouldnât mind hanging with some friends
Itâs upsetting and yet? Kinda fun!
"But if anyone wants footage of me truly wrecking myself, I will send it"
Itâs not ideal! Donât have health insurance so Iâm gonna get that and then get an MRI but urgent room doctor told me to give it a month and see if it heals on itâs own
Yes!! Not even kidding
Wait wtf are you???
Soft tissue damage is not fun
Iâm sorry dude
iâm feelin like cancelling coleâs
ð
Iâm Canadian so I can marry u all
Physically may have torn a ligament in my knee but mentally? The same
How we feeling chat?
All our friends at crushes this year
Followed by googling foid card stuff
Genuinely first instinct this morning
Idk why but I feel we should all start lifting weights
the becektt one?
Thatâs actually the sweetest thing a cousin can say
my cousin who voted for trump first round then got lib brain washed texted me at 3 am saying âsheâs so sorry this is happening and sheâs here for my queer assâ
interview for my stupid email job got cancelled which like would have been really awkward to do today anyways
"Thinking about the little boy who came trick or treating alone last week in small town West Michigan wearing a full suit and cardboard Trump mask, and I actually screamed from fright and terror in his face, he must be being a real piece of shit today at school."
Guy on the train next to me watching avengers endgame on his phone
Is that why you left
Did you get medically locked in for a bit
What if we all moved to Japan
"i tried 10mg adderall, but the world needs me unfocused"
Sure would be a shame if someone dusted the vents
Papa needs a new phone screen
Dust em up
Rent is going up this year
well yeah I guess both of them have dementia now
I'm taking this loss out on my tenants
And misogynistic
Imo
The economy is a huge part but I think Americans are just xenophobic and homophobic to the point where theyâll vote for a dementia devil
like Joe Biden had maybe the worst presidencies in historyâ like I am not even convinced heâs still alive
And peoples kids turning gay
I mean I think itâs like partially the thing of like anyone running against an unpopular incumbent is going to win and unfortunately this time that person was trump
I think the media isnât saying how much of it is Americans being scared of immigrants
But it's also so marginal
"Like, sure, presidents have some impact"
It is just unbelievable that the fate of our country is left up to the arbitrary state of the economy
Fuck donald Trump man
I'm so fucking pissed
My phone fell off my bed last night and the screen broke
She back
I missed Twyman contributing to da chat
"do you think America purposefully made Election Day on Tuesday bc they know the Coleâs mic is on Wednesday so we can all kind of go talk and joke about it the day after ð¤ð¤
Kind of freaking awesome if they did"
Good thing you got the rabies shot!
but something must be done about this kid!!!!
Trumpâs America smdh
sorry
hahahahahahah
Just got bit again
I wish high maintenance was still on so we could get another episode of all of Brooklyn finding out that donald trump is president
"Apparently this is all over twitter, so nevermind, Iâm NOT FUNNY ANYMORE (I was previously and it isnât debatable)"
"Prop 1 passed in New York though, so abortion is protected here. One positive thing!"
This ainât great
"This is really bad obviously, but it would be really funny if they had Maya Rudolph play Hallelujah like Kate McKinnon did"
"in this house:
guns are guns
weâre very curious what the data says
guns are real"
If anything pops off you are all welcome to join my strikeforce
Iâd go halvesies on one
Rule one was no making jokes about assassinating the president online tho :(
"I don't know but yeah, a lot of them do"
Like do I need to get a gun
Those guys are nuts
I looked into joining the socialist rifle association
I'm guessing a lot of people just stayed home because the house and senate are also heavy Republican
Very curious to see what the data says
I just want to look at voting demographics but it won't really settled for a couple days
Itâs terrible
Damn she got cooked
Any news on if any of the local measures passed
They have the house and the senate too
Unbelievable
Yup so he's president again
He just won PA
Oh my god
So fucking annoying
Fuck man....

Well you can call it right now if that's the case
angry emoji counts as 2 everything else is 1 vote
sorry I do that a lot!
what if most of your messages are random and unrelated to what people are talking about
John heart reacts are 1 electoral
Are you determining winning by pure number of likes? Or will there be a weighted likes per post?
and this person will be our president
im downloading my data logs from the last 3 years and will let everyone know who won the chat so far
do you think theyâre gonna let sarah squirm sing hallelujah as ella emhoff if kamala loses?
Stay in line!!
Ok tessa and I are coming

Remember that they have to count mail in ballots and it takes a while to do that
Just a reminder that this is the same thing that happened last election
Itâs really really really close
Ok Iâm gonna stop looking at the New York Times
Itâs looking insanely favorable
Oh trump is gonna win

I didn't even know about 5AM it's like night time but not as fun
well what I'm realizing is that I woke up at 5am today
This was the real ballot
Thatâs so sick you can put nicknames on ballots
Joey realllllly doesnât wanna raise money for Gaza
what if instead of Empty Bottle the great hang with all my friends happened tomorrow at coles
Not only was it funny but it was really smart
This is like Abbott and costello
Figured we could all use a laugh tonight
https://x.com/xnewnorm/status/1853934823183654920?s=46&t=tjr8fF819Bg2cOXeX_FcAQ
Shooting for 8:30
probably later
I hate that vibe but I'm willing to hang
Per empty bottle story they are gonna be showing results on the screen! Also what time are people headed there
We should jam again sometime that was fun
I bet it's pretty easy
So now I'm going to learn it so he and I can be friends
"Yesterday at work, this Jamaican guy thought I said I can play No Woman No Cry and he was so disappointed when I said I couldn't"
Also the 71 year old lady ended her 18 minute phone call with âhope the election ends well and we donât get bombedâ
This is true! Iâd buy face wash from anybody who was able to beat the laws of physics
And said that if we can invent cardboard that doesnât get wet everyone would buy our face wash
But he was bummed that the cardboard boxes we ship in lose from when they get wet
He was trying to buy cardboard boxes from us
Today at my customer service job one of the dumbest people Iâve ever spoken to reminded me to get out and vote
"Customer on the phone just said ""I'm 71 years old and I do whatever the hell I want. Just like Judge Judy."""
Unsure if you actually need to do it but I did just in case
There was a thing on their insta story for âticketsâ which were $0
in a major way
wait weâre having a hang
I might go as well
Yeah I was like why are people giving weird vibes about the empty bottle
hahaha wait that makes more sense
I think itâs also a fundraiser for Gaza
I will prob head to EB as well lmk when people are heading over
and then will probs head there after
iâm getting sushi san w my high school best friend who used to be a lesbian and went straight
I would have loved some rock and roll music but I might settle for hanging with friends
Eh I might come
but itâs simply just the bar is open
theyâre just trying to get a crowd and saying âelectionâ
no not at all
Ok but to be clear itâs not a show
Yeah just sit back and enjoy the show
i mean we wonât know tn
dannyâs going w heeet death
Unsure if I want to experience disappointment with a group
iâll probs head there at 8
"Yeah, I was thinking it'd be cool to hang"
theyâre like âwe have comforting drinks and seats to sit inâ
no bands or anything just literally the bottle lol
What if I made a twitch and streamed all night
no get this itâs just the bottle but theyâre saying âelection nightâ
What is the thing at the bottle? If it involves watching results come in Iâm not interested
youâre gonna elect Biden???
Idk if you weren't always nice to me in high school I'll doxx your ass sorry
Sorry I just doxxed her
Khive girl I went to high school with posting stuff like this
jk xD
Idk I can't really talk because I don't even have a podcast or anything
yeah itâs literally gross and once the election is over iâm gonna cancel her
She writes with such an authoritative voice while editorializing so much
also iâm probs gonna head to EB after dinner
They are having their moment in the sun
nooo but i gotta shit talk her bc reading her language makes me feel dystopian
Where are they at
Remember khive
Its ok to think bernie bros are annoying but I'm not taking you seriously as a political analyst sorry
I used girl i guess in Chicago for city races if I didn't know who to vote for via other progressive endorsements
Nobody should feel bad for using girl I guess but in 2020 she said it was perfectly valid to not vote for bernie because you didn't like the perception of bernie Bros which isn't an illegitimate opinion its just kind of a dumb thing to base an endorsement on rather than the candidates policy or record
And we just vote that person
There should be a position called informed voter
Who do I know whoâs great with water
This is what Iâm working on in the situation room
bureaucratic politics is kind of a symptom and cause of corruption in situations like this
that feels like an argument against democracy
frankly it seems dumb that I should be the one deciding who is on the metropolitan water board
"Yeah, it's too much to know it all on your own"
"I don't feel bad about using Girl, I Guess bc I have always voted based on what someone I know who seems progressive is saying"
Adrienne does not seem to love it
Im calling our living room âThe situation roomâ today
Yes I'm libmaxxing (watching CNN)
I know @Andrew Shankland with appreciate that one
"Also I'm watching CNN and the Georgia secretary of state just said about an alleged Russian voter intimidation hoax, ""they messed with the wrong georgia"""
I actually met the lady I voted for in the school board race she rocks
"Also I think they usually just do endorsements and not full on guides, but they really only endorsed a few school board races this year? Idk I just went with the CTU endorsements/what mary told me for school board"
canât remember exactly but Iâm pretty sure they did because theres nothing the DSA likes better than subdividing itself into too many random groups
They did end up doing this lol
I should get to vote five times for being around long enough to remember when the Chicago DSA wanted to split into a blue line chapter and a red line chapter bc all of the Logan square dsa people were like âitâs actually really hard to go to lakeviewâ
And I was like Kamala is girl boss sorry!
I voted in McHenry county and the judge who gave me my ballot had a shirt that said âwe the people do not complyâ
I've heard other people have this hypothesis and I think it's a pretty valid thing to do lol
they didnât bc itâs not 2018 anymore ð
Rest of the test was pretty easy. I didnât have to cheat
"And as much as I'm shitting on it, I don't want people to feel guilty for using it in any capacity. I just think for things like city council and school board races it's very important to also check in with local orgs in your neighborhood to hear what's really going on. We're lucky to live in a place where are there multiple voter research resources like this, we should utilize all of them"
But they didnât so I also used Girl I Guess for judges
I thought the Chicago DSA wouldâve published a voter guide
I just heard once that judges almost never get booted
And is also not what i did
My very dumb take is that judges are so hard to boot out that you could almost just vote no on all of them and contribute to the bad judges who might be getting enough no's. This is an idea i made up though and is dumb
Injustice watch goes pretty thorough on judges and is super helpful
And I'm sitting here making fun of her but I still used used it
I used it for judge retention
"As Bruce pointed out, she didn't even bother writing any analysis whatsoever on the judges just yes or no lol"
But even someone like her can't get too cute with races like that
I caved and used the guide for the judges and water dept shit
girl i fuckin guess bitch
But you were just being polite
"Ya she'd probably be rude if you were like ""oh i love your voter guide"""
she seems like sheâd be awful at a party
i reread it and want to keep shit talking her
did we all use girl i guess
Powerful post
But i'm basing that on how she doesnt look like either of the ladies in that meme
Lol i am sure she is not
Unless someone tells me Chelsea hood is Latina in which case I will volunteer for the democrats every day for a year
Just seemed like a weird thing for her to post
Wait this is reminding me
Your aunt is Gary Oldman????
Aunt
Ainât posting on her dead husbands fb
Yeah Iâm pretty anti-reality show but I would devour an Alec Baldwin reality show
I am more interested in his fake Latina wife whoâs birthed dozens of children and still has a perfect Pilates body
I mean I do kinda feel bad for him for the whole accidentally killing someone on a movie set thing cause it was that nepo baby non- union person that fucked up and not him but then I remember that time he drunk dialed his daughters voice-mail and called her a nasty little pig
Oh good
Are people aware he has an upcoming reality show
Especially Alec Baldwin
No Irish person has ever done anything wrong
"Southside Irish are either cop loving fascists or like full on maoist militia members, no in-between"
I wonât stand for this slander against my people ð®ðª
And I know from experience that everybody thatâs Italian and Irish on the south side are incredible at being judgmental
"I think there was one Irish judge who's gay, he's chill"
South Side Chirish til I die
Hey man fuck you
"If it says theyâre from Beverly, RUN"
"Irish too mostly, especially Southside irish"
"Yeah you can just safely vote ""no"" on any Italian judge"
from injustice watch
So heâs not legally a child but he canât vote since he isnât a citizen :(
All of these questions should be on the FAQ of the Frankie website
Does he have a fake ID that lists him as a child
Does frankie watch adult porn or
Jeff I donât think the question here is that heâs not an adult. But did he legally change his status to kid
hes not a kid comedian hes a kid comedian
"Can a mod pls deal with this, sick and tired of explaining"
Frankie > Steve Kornacki
Wait Jeff you really should have done Frankieâs Election Covewage
Can Frankie vote or is he legally a kid
ð
"My friend has been posting about voting multiple times, like heâll post âvoted a 5th time, felt great!â And some page messaged him and they were like âhi weâre doing a study about people who do multiple votes, can we use this as evidence?â"
The first election had to redo because everyone voted for themselves
Much better choice than president bone
I wrote in pitterpaw the human cat
"Yeah but some people commit a crime to vote twice in a place that wins by 100,000 votes"
I mean same for voting in general
Idk why anyone would commit voter fraud you get no money and it barely does anything
Iâm voting at Stowe
Whatâs funny is the two party system basically started because Jefferson and adams hated each other
Unless it's 1920 and you're Eugene Debs lol
"Yeah, and that ultimately comes back the the country being designed with the two party system in mind. You need to have Michael Bloomberg money to even try to be independent"
Right but chicago city council is technically non-partisan. If any DSA people run in partisan races they usually have to run as democrats for the funding
"I think the reason for this is just that down ballot races aren't ""sexy"" and they don't have it in them to organize for it"
Especially if it leads to absolute piece of shit Mike Braun losing
Based
DSA had a good run with the caucus of alderpeople in chi
Very excited to see that
The libertarian candidate for Governor might get 20 percent of the vote in Indiana
Working at a polling place no lines
Because libertarians actually do hold some seats here and there but they're gross
I mean the green party not all third parties lol
If third parties were serious about gaining power they'd be running serious campaigns to win city council/state reps seats across the country but they aren't remotely interested in that which sucks!
Jill stein is kind of an egomaniac and her vp is anti trans
Hoover?
What a weird starting point
Kimothy Bednardki?
Mine sent me this
Canât wait to see the things Kim will post over the next 48 hours
Mom just posted this on Instagram
Actually anybody who did wait to vote is kind of stupid?
Just voted with zero wait
Yeah girl I guess has too much power this is wild to me
LOL
omg chet got put in the back of the line next to faux burns and theyâre becoming friends!!!
the guy we all thought was mo burns is here
Yeah u should just be able to vote on ur phone
It should all be done like American Idol voting
And we do need better schools. And everybody should get a silver dollar!
New York has ranked choice for primaries it was awesome
And better schools
We need ranked choice voting
Surely they would sweep the nation with our help
Imagine if there was a third party candidate that won the hearts and minds of this entire chat
Yeah see that is no good for me. Sucks that third party is a joke and probably even more offensive of a vote in the eyes of our collective moms
And apparently he had some things to say about trans people
This is the argument every election and as someone that used to use it I think it is still a bit pie in the sky
Steinâs vp is named Butch
In 2020 the libertarian vp pickâs name was Spike
And we are safe in our blue state not to effect electoral college margin. But yeah I donât really actually know much about Jill Stein other than sheâs the one who supports a ceasefire
My friend has been posting vote Jill Stein stuff not because I think he loves Jill Stein but because if she gets 5% of the vote nationally then they will fund 3rd party campaigns differently and they can be more viable in the future
That being said I do think stein is kind of a crank now
Imagine if a whole town was stein voters
"Game of margins in very specific places though, and it's not like there are a TON of stein voters in rural PA"
Yeah in theory I have nothing against it
And if you completely remove the option of voting 3rd party it removes and way of dissenting from dnc hegemony
"Idk I think the argument is legitimate, it's all a game of margins"
"I guess my take is that third parties usually represent such a small portion of the vote, especially in swing states that it just kind of creates a punching bag for the dems to use if they lose. Like, I only know of two people that have ever cast a ballot for Stein and one of them is me lol"
How tf has the green party survived for wo long
IDK I've been hands off with this election
She is just literally not on the ballot in Illinois
But a friend shared a video of her VP going on the record as being kinda restrictive of abortions
IDK I know that sort of the lib Anti third candidate response
Wouldn't vote for Stein this year but I did in 2012 and still feel ok about it
"Just curious to hear your thoughts because I generally disagree with the ""3rd party candidates siphon democrat votes"" but am open to other perspectivea"
Speak on this Ian
Sorry excuse for a retaining wall
Pfh
"If you haven't worked on any down ballot seats in 30 years, WTF are you actually doing?"
I would think a Russian asset would run a better campaign
AoC has a good take on her
I do think she's sorta being employed as a right wing siphon tho for Kamala votes
I'm writing in Calvin Harris
My brain turns off anytime I see Russian asset as a phrase
Anyone hear this business about Jill Stein being a Russian asset?
Why can't this man be our vice president
Heâs just like me for real
Hey is there a single place to piss in the loop this is nuts
I saw it pop up
He recorded a video on his dad's channel recently lol
I bet heâs in Iowa
John Hickock is gonna love this
victoria based replacement?!?!
"The video for that is great, he says hes gonna give us giant beers"
No part of Milwaukee looks that beautiful
heâs at Coleâs bar
Or here in Chicago
Lol is he in Milwaukee?
It took me 4 hours yesterday :(
Coles hosts trying to encourage participation from the non-comedian crowd
If only he could have puffed loud in the line he could have kept his cool
Heâs too young to handle the pressure of civic duty :(
He like fully registered lol
kid waited in line to register for the first time and then just walked out saying âi actually donât have time to voteâ
Palm is healing up nicely
"Chat wakes up at 5am to vote, but to work, BUDDY, you know chats not getting up before 11am"
"preparing to wait in line in the rain for hours like a soccer mom on the sidelines of American democracy, bitch. Cutting up orange slices for all the election booth ladies"
Jesus Christ why are all you dorks awake
Libraries are the only place there are any social services anymore
At the library
Is this at a polling place too??? Where in the city proper are they anticipating that level of bleeding
hunny I need this for my period
I waited in line for an hour yesterday at Humboldt park and had to bail because I would have been late to work. Apparently people were waiting so long that at like 7:30 last night they gave people in line pizza
Iâm a single issue voter and the issue is the Irish
Like they vote for who the REAL elected school board of Chicago is really gonna be
I bet celebrities have a raya app but for voting
Luke deleted Ãlbum de Luke.
more brick and mortal baggu!!!
excited to vote for the measure that will allow another baggu store to open in Chicago ð«¶
i wonder who the dare voted for
For the elected school bart
I voted for Bart Simpson
I know you guys aren't excited about Kamala but the elected school board is exciting so at least there's that!
hunni thatâs just my opening set at crushes time clock
Time to vote downtown
Luke created Ãlbum de Luke.
coleâs regular is like less hate more pizza
i kinda was like well i kinda want to attack rn
wait what did everyone do for the law thatâs like if someone tries to attack at a voting poll they get fined
on injustice watch thereâs always an alert for judges with Irish names thatâs like âð¨ drunkenly drove car into Lake Michiganâ
"I went at 6am at chase elementary, took like 45 minutes. the voting machine broke immediately lol. All of the ballots are in a blue locker in thr schools art supply room. it's hard to know if that's government issued or some kindergartener is losing a cubby for the day"
Sorry if I'm too active in the chat I'm anticipating being bored as hell
I have an all day pd instead of the day off ð
no way they have good intentions in chicago
Big step
and then i stopped voting for irish names
"Thatâs what Ali did for judges, she just went democrat women. She had more choices she could have used on the guys but she didnât trust it haha"
i stopped listening to the girl i guess list and just voted for all the girls
Never works out
This group chat can have an outsized effect on getting a whereâs my hug guy out of office
The âplayerâs mentalityâ we call it
I was already planning on voting against him because of his gay baby face
Lol letâs goo
Someone your dad knows?
heâs my dads friend and always says i owe him a hug and heâs creepy
hey this is random but donât vote for judge kenneth wright
ok i did it took an hour exactly
But she's also in multiple Pritzker ads
"This girl I went to high school with is a die hard kamala supporter and she was like ""I'm voting for her even though I disagree with her on many issues"" and then didn't enumerate any of then lol"
And heâs going to bomb (Syria)
Pete Buttigieg hanging in the back waiting to take his spot
God it's suck if Tim Walz drops last minute
And sometimes people cancel! Even after the poster is out!
Lol
That's literally how we book comedy shows
Like a verbal confirmation on Instagram with a stranger
"I donât dislike the premise, it just feels very easy to infiltrate"
Especially for weird guys like me that want to make friends
It's an interesting idea tho
Feels like republican trickery
I saw this organization on insta that matches you with someone in a swing state that feels weird about voting for Kamala so you vote for their protest person in the blue state and they vote Kamala in their state
No exactly
If I hadn't sucked it up and voted for Biden in 2020 maybe I would have done it. But fool me twice shame on me
maybe they let me vote faster
If trump wins Illinois I will volunteer every weekend for the democrats for a year
Iâm gonna play podcasts off a beats pill the whole time Iâm in line
But I havenât heard a compelling argument not to use a protest vote in a blue state
Donât tell my mom I said that
No Iâm fully waiting to not vote for Kamala
and I know what mine is telling me to do ð«¶
essentially what Iâm saying is vote with your heart ð«¶ð«¶
The line is moving fast but itâs definitely getting longer. I got here right when it opened at 6 and have been waiting an hour
NYC is also a blue stronghold tho
I left president blank I'll say it
not to be that guy
you like donât have to tho bc illinois and chicago will always be blueâ¦
"It bums me out how much dems are playing the ""it's the most important election of our life"" card again, especially after spending the better part of a year trying to run Biden which should he considered elder abuse"
"Also, same day voter registration which I did a lot lol"
i know itâs past the point but god dammit this is so gay that i have to vote for kamala
Chicago sights are way too small and understaffed I think that's a part of it
In 2020 I got back together with my ex on election day so it's going to he hard to beat that
I might go to the super site downtown bc they have like 70
they fucking want us to give up itâs so insane
five voting booths for an entire presenct
The place I got coffee from wouldn't give me a free coffee because I didn't have a sticker even though I voted early
Iâm going to pretend it took me four hours and take the morning off
It would rock to get fired for voting and file a wrongful termination suit. Easy money
Sorry guys I'll chill
WE ARE NOT GOING BACK
Legally they canât do this btw!
Imagine how exciting today would be if you were someone that loves Kamala tho. Can we be happy for them?
Iâm voting downtown (fml) and Iâm about to get in after an hour or so outside
yoooo i think im about to vote nvm!! an hour wait not too bad
so iâm just like kinda feeling like  really woooozy lol
i accidentally wore too warm of an outfit too
Yeah or a rock and roll themed monster dance
It's just the other option is so bad
yeah!!! itâs not even like a fun ride
It's not even for someone good
Well it's also crazy that you have to wait 6 hrs to vote for kamala
and they know iâm not libtard enough to stake out
they donât want us to vote
yeah dude itâs dystopian
damn I hate America so much :(
"will keep u updated on my wait, im giving up at 8 am"
i havenât heard of anyone who hasnât waited yet
ugh dude iâm sorry itâs more likely than not
I have to go down to Bridgeport today and if I have to do that after waiting 2 hours in the rain Iâm going to kms
like iâm just lucky i donât work today but my job would fire me if i did t show up bc of voting
it literally is because who has the fucking time to vote besides old people then
It was never like this before
sorry but thatâs incredibly prohibitive to literally everyone and is essentially voter intimidation
am i crazy or was it never like this before
no literally
I feel like we should all be entitled to a class action lawsuit for having to wait more than one hour to vote
iâm a bad american but iâm leaving after hour 2
yeahâ¦. in lowkey like how did anyone wait 6 hours
Iâve always voted at this library
iâm also like confused if iâm voting in twenty minutes or voting in two hours bc the line wraps around a hall
not to be like a bitchâ¦ but I have a really bad cold rn and I think itâll put me in the ground if I have to wait in the rain
look yours up now if ya donât know it bc itâs confusing
but also it took me like a second to figure out which presenct iâm in
fuck
seems promising
Iâm abt to head out to Logan square library hoping thereâs not a crazy line
iâm 45 min in
goethe
which polling place are you at?
iâm in line rn hoping it isnât the same wait as everyone else lmao
anyone try to vote at like 6 am
It was the universal monsters rock n roll show hosted by Japanese Beatlejuice
Japanese Beetlejuice is one of the greatest performers of our lifetime
All I know is
If I knew what the hell was going on id tell ya
Who are those two guys
I have mostly good things to say about Japanese beetlejuice at the moment
Say what you will about Japanese Beetlejuice but his crowd work is as sharp as ever
"Because of Palestine, right?"
so cool!
Well just a handshake
Woah invited to the couch to chat
Maddie weiner about to do standup on Jimmy Fallon in like 5 minutes
How da hell does he come up with such outlandish scenarios
I was waiting for his endorsement but it took too long
Wish I wouldâve known this before I voted
Shit he's gonna undo the hinchcliff stuff
Never meet your heroes ð
that actually helps a lot to confuse me more thank you!
Will you be more confused when I say that The Rock voices Maui
watching moana and really confusedâ is maui based on jason momoa or is jason momoa based on maui?
What a turn that'd be
Haha what if he does?
We just elected this guy
It's Nov 5 in Japan the election is happening
But there is no set of circumstances where Trump concedes
If it's decisive enough yeah
We might know who wins the general before we know every state
Yeah I mean best case scenario is two months of lawsuits and bullshit
"Also, I don't think we'll know who won tomorrow. It'll drag out just like 2020 I bet"
DNC is still doing 800% matches for donations
I knew I should have spent more money on TV ads
God dammit Adrienne
i voted for tony to continue getting texts
Such a banger!
They're all for the God damn school board too!! Fuck your charter school money I already voted for the single mother candidate!!! Eat my ass!!!!!!!
Don't get complacent
Midterms will be here sooner than you think
Bro I am still getting political texts!! I was told this would stop when I voted!!!! I need this shit to be over
"If anyone besides Ian likes anime going to this, seat m-8"
Mumble into the wind and heâll be there
how do I contact Joe Swanberg
Me too
Iâm a sicko and actually like the vibes of voting in person
I listen to that one a couple of times a year
Now I can do my report cards
Iâve been voting by mail since like 2015 and cannot fathom voting in person! I voted literally at the end of September
Lines are way shorter on the actual day of because thereâs like 1000 more voting locations
I early voted this year but normally I vote Election Day
I've been doing it ever since
It rolled over from 2020 by default
Why aren't all of you already doing mail in voting
Ty sm
It was Dan Pfifferâs
It wasnât Jon Lovettâs
I have to apologize
i ruined a friendship for sending him a naked taz
@Mitchell Potts which chapo episode do they dunk on Jon Lovetts book? I'm trying to find it
"At least we don't have to do a ""caucus"" like those pig fuckers in Iowa"
I swear to God I'm doing mail in voting next year
She might actually make me lose faith in the democratic process :(
this might count as voter intimidation
Thatâs fair
I would but then i would have to spend more time with her
I donât know what sheâs doing is illegal but it should be
You should perform a citizenâs arrest
Wake up!
you should start doing system of a down
"She is telling every man ""you'd be prettier if you smiled more"" and idk if she's subverting the trope or what. Everyone she says it to hates it"
One of the songs was Hazy Shade of Winter
It's like a marathon of annoying things she's doibg
"She's also making a gap in the line saying ""i'm not from chicago i know yall like to be all up on each other but i LIKE MY PERSONAL SPACE"""
Songs youâve heard or does it sound like sheâs just got the music inside of her?
I'm an hour into waiting in line to vote and the woman i'm behind has been singing loudly the whole time and telling every person that walks past us they should smile more
Iâll send to you
Who cares
Someone sent a naked taz and green m&m
Send to chat
ð
ð
ð
It's swollen can confirmed
Iâll send them to you
I do want to see but I don't speak for the group at large
Itâs pretty bad ð
I have pics of how swollen my knee is if anyone wants them
Me!
Also guess who fucked his knee up so bad that heâs on crutches?
"Itâs casual but like not in a slob way, I think thatâs fine"
I mean the fit is casual but casual is chill I don't see the problem
I promise to not make this my personality for long
itâs a majority trans staff too
Absolutely insane
That sucks so much
theyâre like mad at the trans girl for wearing earrings and itâs so bad
they keep yelling at anyone whoâs not cis itâs soooo obvious
iâm like wait this is literally the nicest shirt i own
"Yeah I see you in the shirt and I'm like ""where's the regatta""?"
preppy even
itâs literally a shirt that my coworker is wearing too
rugby shirts are like a classic type of shirt
I literally wore a shirt exactly like that to work yesterday

iâve been wearing this outfit for the last two years here hahahaha
me looking like i came off the street
i do have another job
Idk if you have other gigs or something but yeah fuck that
"1. I wanna see the fit
2. That's something that would 100% make me wanna quit and I wouldn't blame you if you did"
send the fit
iâm WEARING A COLLARED SHIRT
she said âwe canât have the front desk looking like they just came off the streetâ
"Donât go off on her, take her money"
Go off with a lawsuit
and itâs like u canât tell me to wear a tighter shirt
when i wear BOY clothes
itâs so fucking insane this keeps happening to me
Lawsuit
and then go off on this women
iâm gonna wait to see if i get this full time job at becketts company
I think if I keep smelling bad they'll let me work from home forever
i also make minimum wage so like they canât expect me to literally wear something so nice
To document it
Take photo of your outfit
i look like lowkey good
I came into the office today and I straight up reek
iâm literally wearing a collared shirt
but she still was like âno shade youâre dressed casualâ
Lawsuittttt
Lawsuitttt
and my manager is on my side
bc itâs some higher up
my manager is documenting it
Did anyone witness it
Document it!!
just pants and a golf shirt
they canât put a finger on why they donât like my outfit. and itâs the exact same outfit that the guy who makes 20k more than me is wearing en
i think iâm gonna walk out haahahahah
and itâs clearly bc i am wearing boy clothes

Wait I like this

Have you ever considered that you might have a different birthday in America if you were born in Australian time?
Way to go @mr sunday !! You were born and youâre still alive!
Happy birthday @mr sunday
lol! I wanna befriend some Mennonites on here but it looks like theyâre all friended up
Monday motivation ð
We were in Michigan canvassing for Kamala and are going back to Chicago!
Amtrak is the best place in the world to make friends. I talked for a long time with a traveling church organist who asked me if the train would stop in Seattle before it stopped in Fargo
Where are you going?
On the Amtrak with my friend Sue
Family guy karaoke bar
Got ice cream at Osaka Castle
Yeah hey lets talk about something else yall
ð¤ 
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer added Brook Whitehead to the group.
Oh he was
"Had no idea he was a prize fighter in Poland, not sure if you were joking about that but I 100% believe it"
Whereas I look an even more feeble and flabby michael cera
"He's like 6'5"" and built like a brick shithouse"
Yeah that factored into it
He wouldve punched you in the face if you said he couldnt go up
"I mean it was like him and 3 other slobbering drunk old heads, and like a handful of other comics in the whole room. Feeling guilt pangs about it rn"
I could have stopped it
That must have been like the one week I stayed home sick
"That was literally the moment I was like ""I do not want to host an open mic anymore"" lol"
"He came to lotties one night with a bunch of other old heads, all of them piss drunk and went way WAY over time. I knew about his bad reputation but it was like 1 am and we just let him go up anyway. Feel shitty about it still"
But yeah definitely a piece of shit
He is an enormous man
lmfao what
Was a championship boxer in poland and is a terrifying person
"He works at cleo's now i think, earlier this year he punched blake burkhart in the face"
I guess it goes without saying that it pisses me off
Pisses me off
But anyone that books him sucks too
Its like enough people that knew about it moved
Weirdly some people started booking him again in the last year or so
He was my favorite comic when i was young here but nope definitely a piece of shit and definitely a rapist
What a shame this is reallllllly good ð
He is a rapist
Junior was like the only Chicago comedian on one of those Vulture âcomedians you will knowâ things. He was pretty big relative to the scene and then got cancelled for a reason I donât know
https://youtu.be/fe6cUISbIPU?si=dGJeokYBonHSGLEy
Heâs like an edgelord that wears pigtails
I also donât know who Junior is
My dadâs response to meeting Pete B
Thatâs the only explanation that doesnât involve him having a mental breakdown
I genuinely think he had to have lost a bet
Can anyone in this chat fill me in  on junior stopka? Who is this guy and why is John hickok obsessed with him
"Trying not to do bits or isolate !!

This is growth ð"
i'm sorry aaron!!
Really sorry to hear that Aaron
Japan is gonna be great
damn Iâm sorry dude!!
Iâm sorry bud
"I'm gonna go to crushes or the wills mic tn, hmu if you wanna hang! @Aaron Klopfer"
So sorry buddy
Aww man I'm so sorry dude
Love u
Iâm sorry man thatâs rough
Sending hugs pal
So sorry Aaron !!
"I got dumped in a pretty rough abrupt way.

I could use distractions. Please invite me to stuff, I might just be quiet in the corner but I think it would help me heal to be around folks."
Idk what is going on
Iâve have never had to wait even 30 mins in the past
No but the ballots are a lot shorter here
People aren't reading the Damm girl I guess voters guide in there!
But I have a theory why
I never did it in Illinois it was so convenient took 5 min
Yeah idk what it is but early voting is way easier in nyc
"Itâs very quick here, why is it so fucked in Chicago?"
Oh my god really?
Almost to the front
I have been in line to vote since about 2pm
Roemember Roemember the fifth of November
Sheâs a huge lib and a huge Brian Roe fan
who will clean ur toilets mr trump
She followed me first ð
Oh are you following my mom on ig too?
Thinking about going to see Anora tomorrow night if anybody wants to join
and my review will be: it DOESN'T stink
I don't read books by men unless Jon Lovitz finally decides to take up the pen
No
"I heard a story about someone seeing Job Lovitz in public and being like, ""you're Jon Lovitz!!"" And him just responding, ""Jealous?"""
Did you mean Jon Lovitz?
Damn chat was epic this morning
Going to hit the food court
Might be picking up from IKEA tomorrow
Ok :)
One could say âyouâre going the distance on this oneâ
Not in a good mood no Ty
Can I tell you what I tell everyone
Just lmk
Would love to drive with some buds
Going to comedy on state Wednesday for da mic
Mary wants to take a vacation to Potomac Maryland cause of that show
I lead the charge on Pro-Lisa Barlow issues
Respect
Fuck I'm still in line and I'm missing the broncos game now
I am an active voter at wwhl.tv
#RidinWithBiden #BidenStrong #JeSuiBiden
I like this idea
Sorry I'm already writing in Biden
No worries if not!
Would be sick to come in like 21st
Anyone want to write my name in for president?
https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBxdonkOtYc/?igsh=MXc4dmw3ZWloeGM0Nw==
The Selzer poll and the Andy Cohen Whatâs What Happen Live push poll has me feeling pretty good about things
Also probably gonna go to empty bottle on election night should be a good hang
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer set the nickname for Andrew Shankland to unregistered marxist.
Something entertaining to look at during this two hour wait
Also there is a volleyball tournament at my voting place
"He wrote a song about him called ""mean old Mr trump"" or something"
Trumps dad was also woody Guthrie's landlord lol
I voted for Kristin Gillebrand which was tough bc I hate blondes
Also if we're voting based on dads Trump's was a literal klan member
Tbf he is a Marxist but she also think that means facist
"And I was like ""oh shit I forgot to re-up my membership!"""
Someone at work said her dad was a registered marxist
I know Kamala is not progressive enough for most of the chat but if it makes you feel better according to my parents we are all voting for a communist sleeper cell â¤ï¸
Vote for Kamala so Tony Hinchcliffe will have a little footnote in future social studies books
"Literally doing the ""oh you guys don't like that one"" shit at fucking Madison Square garden"
Comedy is so powerful
That kill Tony clip was so fucking insane. He was treating it like an open mic. That guy is such a shitty comic and person it's unbelievable that he really might change the course of American history lol
No he is I eas just being cheeky
Shank is a fake fan
No he's still doing it
I mean james Austin Johnson has the trump impression spot on there now right? Or is he not on the cast anymore
And Iâve gotta see that
Ann Selzerâs poll has Harris + 3 in Iowa which could mean an ultimate humiliation for Trump/Musk/ Kill Tony
In a way it's like we're voting for if we want Alec Baldwin or Maya Rudolph to guest more on snl
Single issue voter here
Also Elon needs to be humiliated I'm sorry
"Iâm writing in Hilary again, give her a chance"
Reading girl I guess and shaking my head so everyone knows I did independent research
And there are actually some good judges on there that are worth retaining. Like there's one on here that ruled in favor of a tenants union in a housing case. We gotta keep her
"And now itâs like fuck, now  we have to vote"
Civil crime
Like people who jump turnstilesâ¦
I feel like itâs because we all thought Kamala was a guarantee
"Yeah, i think a lot about how it ultimately affects sentencing for petty crimes"
There's only so many hours in a day to listen to podcasts and video essays
I feel like judges is maybe our most impactful vote bc so many people probably skip that
You can narrow it down based on your ballot but it's still a lot to read lol
And that's coming from me!
It's really useful tbh
That's fine imo there's so many fucking judges you gotta have a life at some point
j feel like a month ago everyone was like iâm not voting
Injustice watch has a far more detailed judge guide
"Sometimes I'll read it and be like ""lol that's dumb as hell"" and then vote for someone she doesn't like because they represent my values better"
This year for judges she just said âIâm not elaborating hereâs the yes/no listâ
I just have a personal grudge against Stephanie skora and that's my problem
Reading girl I guess and forming an opinion based on what she says is research
Nah you're good it's a fine guide at the end of the day
but donât say ur a political comic
I know itâs probably bad to rely so much on one persons opinion but in what world am I gonna independently research hundreds of candidates
cum is political
"Heck, I even read some of it!"
everything i do is political
no thatâs what iâm sayin
I used it in Chicago
Also Iâm gonna vote today am I not allowed to use the girl I guess guide?
"There are a lot of funny people that do good political humor but anyone that labels their comedy as ""political"" is sus"
Apparently my aunt was going to marry an Italian guy and my Irish great grandmother kept saying âsheâll never be happyâ
what do u mean u want to write for the daley show
political comics are random to me
And I've been waiting to get that stuff about Julia Claire off my chest
Nobody else does lol
Never apologize for spamming the chat
Sorry for spamming the chat today but I'm still in line to vote and bored out of my mind reading these judge guides and this made me literally laugh out loud
Right wing political commentator lookin ass boi
Mary put me in a snapchat filter that makes you look like a politician and I look like Matt walsh
And they have worked on major campaigns so some of their insight is worth listening to but I kinda can't stand them
That exactly how I feel about it
Pod save is good if you wanna know what the middle of the road dems are thinking about shit
Like they print money off orange man bad
"Like, don't they kind of stand to gain if Trump wins?"
One of the best episodes of Chapo is when they made fun of Jon Lovettâs book
I guess Roald Dahl was a big racist though
I hate the Pod Save shit
Too good for James and the giant peach then eh
Famed feminist thinker Jon Lovett
Lmaooooooo
I went on a date once with this girl who was like a DNC diehard and she told me she never reads books by men except she made an exception for Jon lovett
But I like Kate a lot I think she's great
And working w crooked media only underlines that to me like at that point just work for the dnc
"Or like, she always struck me as someone who was just more of a grifter"
Didn't know they broke up
Her dad's a cop and a lot of her takes were way soft imo
Kate Willet is really nice
Lol
She used to be kind of a leftist but now she works for crooked media after having a pod w Kate Willet who I like her
She's pretty and tall and posts about politics that's all I really know about her
I just don't like her lol
What's her deal is there tea
Yeah lol
The new york comic?
Does anyone care about Julia Claire at all
The one I do did with a lot is 48th Ward Neighbors For Justice which my gf founded ð I'm so proud of her and love her so much
iâm just gonna text the guy who was the president of the socialist club at depaul and ask him who do i vote for
"IPOs usually have names like ""35th Ward Working Familes""(that's the Logan one I believe)"
DSA as well
CTU also has endorsements
I would recommend looking up if you guys have any independent political organizations (IPOs) in your ward/neighborhood and see who they endorse
yeah i def wanna hear
itâs also funny bc the obvious answer is i should do my own research
If anyone wants to hear more about this give me three beers and I will give you a very detailed account
I'm also just a little bitter about how she endorsed the other candidate in a race I volunteered on lol
itâs also like fucked up that sheâs just like âi donât like this guyâ
https://windycitytimes.com/2022/04/12/latest-brave-space-alliance-situation-reveals-conflicting-accounts/
Yeah it's a little insane that the most popular progressive voter guide in America's third largest city is a Google doc written by one or two people
I'm a little fuzzy on the details
She was the head of Brave Space Alliance and when they tried forming a union some shady she went down while she was in charge
Sorry working families or whatever
"Like her Endorsements often boil down to ""vote green or family labor"""
"I mean, lost of orgs do Endorsements and tbh if you know the parties it can be enough"
iâm sure thereâs like gotta be another resource right
I thought it was two people? She names another person in the intro
hmmmm
It used to be two or three people but now it's just her
i feel like the girl i guess should be like a whole team of people thatâs insane
"She really brings her own personal grievances into her Endorsements and will be like ""just vote this way bc I don't like the other person"""
Speak on this I haven't heard but I'm curious
She is Jewish to be fair
And also it's like why is one white lady allowed to tell every neighborhood how to vote
I heard the girl I guess lady is a union buster
New york ain't doing it like this
"yeah actually i think the criticism 
is that itâs fine but you should do more research"
I think there are a lot of valid criticisms you can make of her but I do not believe she is cancelled
did i make that up
isnât girl i guess cancelled
And we have more rats ð
Took me 5 min almost all the judges were unopposed dems
Yeah we do things a little bigger here
The ballot in NYC is so small compared to Chicago
But there's so many it took like half an hour to fill in all those damn bubbles
I just followed girl I guess and I feel like it was like 60/40 yes/no
"I do enjoy reading injustice watch's stuff though, these judges are so petty and corrupt"
"Sometimes ill check to see if there are any thst are definite ""yes"" but most are bad"
I think that's mostly fine
"Do you guys just vote ""no"" on every judge? I ain't reading all that"
"I'm in line to early vote, quickly googling ""what is kamala harris' whole deal"""
Idk what she did but richie's version woul've been the move
I looked it up she didnt call him that
wait is this real
Kamala just called Trump the f word on snl
4032 n Sheridan rd fun Halloween party
Youâre missing out!!
Fun Halloween party
Oh shit
They're playing the green bay gamblers
I love minor league hockey
I'll let you know about the next one
Also doing a steel game tonight @Luke Ipsum sorry I should have told ya
This is only the first step on my health journey
I forgot to tell you guys I'm doing No Candy November if anyone wants to join me
"A guy panhandling outside walgreens just now said ""wake up!"" And i laughed and went ""grab your brush and put on a little make up"" and he looked at me really confused and turns out he was just making a joke that i looked sleepy. Not everyone is trying to do system of a down songs with you"
my gf bought a car with her cop lawsuit money lol
I hate cops
One for 150 and one for 200
I got slapped with two tickets in two days
They're trying to fill budget gaps
End of the year
That's what I was thinking tbh
I think they were just going ham cause of Halloween looking for drunk drivers but they got me cause my plates are technically expired or whatever
hell yeah
oh duh
Johanna Medranda runs don't tell there I believe
thereâs a donât tell there right
He good boy
Reach out to Brett Mercer
"I went to Windsor and it was kinda weird, but Canada as a concept is interesting"
wanna do a detroit trip and book some shows for shits and gigs
anyone ever done shows in detroit?
Voters have too many rights these days
Voter intimidation :(
Lmao why'd they pull you over?
I NEED TO WORK ON MY HOUSE FUCK YOU
Frankie's doing a Folsom prison style album in juvie
Starting a go fund me to get Jeff out of prison!
It was amazing. an absolutely incredible party. @johncrete definitely went and if he doesn't go all future bad things will be because he altered the timeline
Also checkout my aunt posting on her dead husbands fb
@Ian Erickson how was it?
"Gf is having a Halloween party, all welcome !"
"I did poppers tonight, and the only thing it opened up was my heart ð"
@Jeff Braun video but real life
In many ways I agree
This is really Kristi coded
"Kristi is here come over yall 

2911 N Spaulding Ave"
Could not remember if it was you or mcshane that told me that hahahaha
This someone was me and it was a hilarious tension. tables of models and people who should not be allowed to see them in real life
I just saw Lori lightfoot
Dude New Norm fell off
ugh finally
Happy birthday Kristi!
It was unbelievable. Kristi's beautiful birthday was incredible. Everyone celebrated in their own way. I celebrated by being in japan
And yes there's a new episode ð
For your wall @Richie Owens
ð¤
I'm in too deep
Mom needs to send a pic or it didnât happen
literally blaming me for the water breaking
SUCH moments speak omg
âyou decided to be bornâ
Also lucia I don't think you should do anything you're uncomfortable doing but $6k is $6k and if you did a pro-palestine set and donated a bunch of money that's something you can be proud of
I get all my political updates from the kill Tony subreddit
Iâm still not over his influence on our nation
ð©
Finally a crowd that will appreciate your bit about the pornhub app
Don't even get me started on president bone
They will LOVE my jokes about porn
Gimme your spot
Lucia
You gotta get me in that room
Oh man that'd be amazing lmao
you couldâve given me a million guesses and I wouldâve never guessed that Tony Hinchcliffe would be the October surprise
Damm comedy really can change the world
"""top subscribers"" sends a chill down my spine"
and see if they post the clip hahah
I'm gonna do a pro palestine set and donate 10% to palestine
Someone told me there were models and then a lot of old guys in suits at the taping they went to
So there could be a sinister horny energy in that room
If this makes any difference to you - I heard during the taping they invited top models AND top subscribers to watch the taping
I deleted that message because I forgot a very important negative in there
I think I'm gonnna do a pro palestine set
I'm going to unequivocally say that you should take the money
hahaha
Making 10k and supporting Israel - sounds like a win win no?
"yeah idk I think itâs also worth trusting your gut and like probably the only reason they give so much money is bc they know people donât want to be associated with them. And like I think if youâre not like hurting for money itâs worth evaluating the non-monetary things youâd gain from this. Like of course an extra $6k is nice, but what else would you be getting from doing something you might feel like youre compromising yourself ethically"
"Yeah, I think if youâre not doing anything to directly beneficial for Israel/AIPAC by doing this taping youâre morally in the clear. 

Just by participating in the American economy - weâre all participating in something that benefits morally dubious people.

That being said - if it makes you feel guilt, if might not be worth doing"
Also Tyler horvarh only got like 2k or something
but i also think you can trust your gut and i've always found it weird that my friends are doing onlyfans like this!
I will say that I subscribe to multiple onlyfans accounts and itâs truly the âno ethical consumptionâ thing. I donât think just being a contributor like that is helping or hurting that guy any more than like every other evil person we give our money to or make money off of
They're throwing money in a very strange place considering what they're known for
Get yo money
Unless you expect to earn them 10k+ in return
I don't think you should take my advice - but I think taking money away from the bad people can be good
"but when I met with them i had a weird feeling in my gut (partly don't want to be associated with only fans) but also I just googled only fans israel ties, and the owner has donated at least $11 million to AIPAC throughout the genocide"
I was offered to do that onlyfans taping and it pays sort of an absurd amount - at least 6k upwards of 10k if you post a certain amount
hey guys i need some group conscience
danny surprised me w le bouchon nvm!!
Lots of good thrift stores in edgewater. Patio Beef is good for a quick dog/burger. Gino's North best Tavern style pizza in the city

Oak Lawn
@Ian Erickson how was Kristi's birthday in Japan?
Oh i didnt know that but yeah looks like you can!
you can take the lake bike path trail there though right?
"My favorite thing to explore in chicago is steelworker's park and the surrounding area, it's this whole abandoned area  that used to be a steel mill and looks post apocalyptic. Bit of a drive though"
Iâve heard rly good things abt broadway antique market in edgewater if you wanna go lake vibes with some light shopping
no somewhere that requires traveling more than 20 min!
Nobody knows what's up there
Hermosa
Happy birthday Kristi!
was thinking pilsen! but might lean towards the lake
every bday i go to a neighborhood and walk around
what neighborhood should i explore
"Good enough for Mitchell, good enough for me"
Even if itâs bad - I wonât have to travel for it
I think I probably will
Is anyone submitting for windy city comedy fest lol

Thinking of designing a shirt for betas that says âchai tea over high tâ
"They really stand for the pledge of allegiance here, but aside from that itâs pretty chill"
but if 2005 this would be a big part of my life I can tell you thart

Absolutely insane vibes for Halloween at school today
But we looking good as hell
Gotta move the electrical outlet directly underneath it
Studio sink is installed!
"yeah it's from that video where the pumpkin says ""my name is lewis"" from like 4 years ago"
kind of hilarious!
"the pumpkin says ""my name is lewis"""
"not in a way that words can describe, but yes"
I have been thinking about this all month
I don't know why
Weâre shopping Halloween bc we waited last min for baby costume
Pumpkin guy at targets name is Lewis
Does anyone understand this tee shirt
Calling out of work

You guys wanna see?
I just sliced open my palm in the garage lol
"But donât worry guys, I wonât lose heart â¤ï¸"
Yeah I sent the clip as a courtesy? He has seen me plenty of times I didnât imagine he would bother watching it
i lose heart every time i see chris trani and he introduces himself to me (have known him for 5 years)
"AND never forget that I found him trying to climb Johnâs fence to get out instead of pushing the button to unlock the door, and then scooter off in the wrong direction"
But donât lose heart Megan!
"Also itâs so easy to find 5 minutes to watch a clip, and heâs probably seen you perform a bunch lmao."
âDonât lose heartâ is kinda like âI know that this is probably really affecting your lifeâ
Wait that seems polite and reassuring tho?
Oh my god
I regret submitting for the HOB show
Let me out!
Yankees lose da world series
Trick question: it's bad luck to have lunch on Halloween

Hey Clare and I are moving my apartment into a box truck tonight around 5. If anyone wants to come help for some pizza and beer. With any amount of people it should be super quick
This shirt that Ca7riel is wearing in his tiny desk concert is so sick lol

Little tip from ol Aaron
Someone just made a cum joke in the break room at work
A beautiful mind in an ugly world
Papa!!!
John Paul II is on Twitter?!?
Sorry John Paul beat you to it
They stitch it onto some gentiles foreskin
Can I be buried in a Jewish cemetery?
But what do they do with the tattoo skin
Wild
Then bury you without it
that's what I figured
After you die
LOL
They flay the skin with the tattoo off
Do you want to hear how
Not under my watch
I figured out that you can actually
Think of your family
You can't be buried in Jewish cemetery
No
Should I get a tattoo
That was 2023's joke of the year
Didn't you already write President Bone?
Hahahaha
Wait can I see
We'll see how it goes
Ok I think I just wrote the joke of the year
Excellent episode btw
this happened in king of the hill
Egg sandwich pic plz
"Paula Skaggs once went to a hotel in Japan and was like âwow this is smallâ and was in it for hours before she realized one of the walls was actually a sliding door into the actual, bigger room"
The 7/11s rip
But yes we do love the Halloween tree
Room is a lil smaller than we thought
Quick- what do Americans like
And they fit that whole tree into an hotel room the size of a drawer?
They do things a little different over here
Seems strong. Iâll probably go soon but many have just arrived
Whatâs the word on the crooners at Kerry-Ike
How long will you guys be there?? I am trying to close a Longman and it is taking forever â¾ï¸
Lol u bastards ð

They have no idea itâs a full croon tonight
Feral and vibrant

Happy birthday Kerry!
Bringing pie and a Kringle
Omw stole forks from work
Be so for real are you guys at kerry-oke yet
"For Kerry-oke, not jack white"
If someone brings plates and forks I can bring some pastries from work
sooo gay that phlyzzz isnât opening for jack white
Happy birthday kerry
Guys are always selling this on the street in nyc I gotta get one
"when I was a kid there were a bunch of rooms in my dads house he didnât put any furniture in bc he was like âIâm just one guy, I canât go in that many roomsâ and we had this one room that was completely empty save for this big poster of the rat pack. So that is kind of what crooner means to me."
kerry can u define crooner
itâs a way of life
crooning is not a costume
Iâve got the perfect shirt but itâs not a costume so Iâll be dressed as Kerryâs friend with an appropriate shirt
crooner attire encouraged (whatever that means to you)
diverting my party to Ryanâs show
Is Kerry-oke a costumed affair
I wish I could go tho
I'm starting to get a little sick from rebecca's sickness so I'm probably not gonna make it to Kerry's unfortunately
I will support from here
I support you going and reporting back
"I want to support my friend Ryan Oliver, but I donât want to support the laugh factory by buying a ticket + 2 drinks"
I want to hear about it but I simply cannot put myself through that experience
Not being mean but I cannot imagine what the vibe in that room will be
Definitely the better way to spend tonight!
sorry that was MEAN iâm going to kerryâs bday
noâ¤ï¸
Is anyone going to go to Ryan Oliverâs hour tonight?
Happy Birthday Kerry!
Yes happy birthday Kerry!
And to Kerry? Allow me the first to say happy birthday!
"Yeah i dont think thatll rub anyone the wrong way, worst case they already have it booked"
Ok im going for it
Because then they donât even have to think about your availability
I think clubs even like if you ask for a particular person to work with
they'll probably just ignore you if it doesn't line up right?
Zanies
which booker?
i donât thiiiiiiink so?
Do bookers get mad if you ask to host/feature for someone on the schedule?

Yall are idiots. Thatâs a classic Chicago way to make sure vampires donât steal your garbage.
"""I'm not gonna put them in the can, someone out there might need some faith."""
Someone is having a really bad day
"Ugh weâre gonna have to be like âin this climate, itâs so important to laughâ"
"That's what I call the complete unraveling of society ""a little shake up"""
"Honestly, I've been a little bored post covid I could use a little shake up"
Like it couuuld destroy American democracy forever but my main concern is that it sounds like an annoying time period to live through
I fear trump losing and contesting the election might really damage the vibe
If trump wins the democrats are gonna roll over and take it like the good little subs they are
Oh great theyâre gonna make us shelter in place for the democrat civil war ð
The context was she think this is why the department of Ed is making us set up Google classrooms for remote work
God I hope that happens
A woman I work with said that if Trump wins the election the democrats won't certify it and it will cause a civil war
Yeah Iâm like how did I become his Momager
Brian Johnson is bound for great things
It's called delegating

And then asked me to log into his YouTube account to upload the video for him
Brian Johnson had me record his set at a mic
i feel bad still but yeah i guess itâs ok
ok phew
He only seems to do shows at butch mcguires
If it makes you feel better thereâs zero chance youâll ever run into him
i feel bad haahahaha
ðªº
Hahahahahaha
hahaha AHHHH
and the host VA  responded back âhmmmâ
i dropped the butch mcguires show
I think you've found your calling
I wish people asked anime questions more in my day to day life that felt great

What a day for old heads
ðªº
Eric Sony and Hypnosis set the nickname for Johnbo Walter Stockwell to johncrete.

John i think you would be the person all of us would ask if we were wondering that
DO NOT PISS ME OFF
Omg Kerry gets added to the REAL chat in t-minus 3 hours
Maybe I'll just use a driveway sealant next year or something
but painting it would be easier....
I'm debating applying concrete on it directly and just smoothing it out
you guys think I'll get in trouble with the city if I paint the asphalt in the alley behind my house? I want to smooth out the surface a little bit just so I can skateboard on it
You think turning one year older entitles you to plow through the riches of an empty movie theater?
"It's ok Sam, I understand"
You can ask ANYTHING you want ðððð

I kinda like this premise tbh
That eyebrow raise commands expertise
I always liked Boyce
I donât really know anything about Basil but I just remember him being pretty tight with Corey and then all that shit went down with him
He went right wing right after everyone called his shit out
Menace

You have a better pulse on the Indiana boys tho idk
Corey was shitty to him but not at the level basil was
I think basil
Or however you spell it
Probably Corey Coruchiee
Ya who was he talking about
who is he referring to?
I love him dearly but I have a list  of comics who did me dirty too
"He good boy, I would be mad too tho if I were u"
Zach Boyce is a really nice dude tho afaik
Hahahahaha
Really missed the mark with the context huh Sam
Hahahahahahaha

Last couple times they hid themselves
He's anti Vax I think
I think the maga base really feels like this is the last chance to save the country so theyâre out in full support
The culture war is over and the right has won
"It really goes to show how fucking stupid most people watching standup are that they buy Tony's bullshit wholesale. I got a post from the kill Tony subreddit shown to me and the were all like ""hello it's called comedy"""
Iâve also never seen so much maga stuff in Chicago

Lmfao
"Ian told me he needs this to be one of the best nights of his life, so please be punctual"
Can't wait to see everyone tonight for dinner/karaoke
But the tone was prank like
I canât remember the details now bc it was during aoc so a little hectic
I can now admit that he told me he replaced the sword
Just like that broad city episode where they keep referencing broad city episodes
Sorry i'm always relating every situation to a broad city episode
This is just like on broad city when abby pegged the guy and put the dildo in the dishwasher and ruined it and tried to to get a new dildo but didnt know the guy had very specific taste in dildos
I figured like maybe he broke it and tried to replace it on the low? And just like was afraid to tell me? Or just mixed it up?
And like he didnt even acknowledge that there could be a difference when I said anything
I'm just as confused
Lmao I have no idea
Whatâs he up to? ð¤
For sure
Like this is just objectively a different and newer sword lol
"I let judd crud borrow it, and I'm like 99% sure he gave me back a different knights of Columbus sword"
Yah
@Jonathan Dunne do you remember if the knights of Columbus sword had a wooden handle?
Eric on that 70âs show ð ð

Anatomy of Lies. Doc about the Grays Anatomy writer who faked having cancer to get on the show. Itâs nuts
Its like greek mythology done all modern which sounds lame but i liked it. Jeff goldlum is zeus
*bum
Although it will bun you out cause its so good and got canceled after season 1 already
Kaos was such a good show and flew under the radar

Does anyone wanna help me carry some furniture in exchange for me filming something for you? ð§
This show is so funny
Has the bear done an episode where they take improv classes at second city to get better at their jobs
If you wanna understand restaurants better you gotta check out a little tv show called FXâs The Bear
Meat is so clutch when it comes to some restaurants
I'm thinking about eating meat again so that I can understand restaurants better
"Also I liked the vibe. Just a bunch of old Korean rock vinyls and the style was p tasteful. 

I feel like there's always a chance a place like this could be done in a way where it just feels like they're ripping like a fast-fashion sense of style from Tik Tok and it feels like cheap or that it's gonna be outdated in like 3 years"
But i felt like everything we had was really really good and decently priced for the quality
I feel like it has the potential to be one of those places that pops off on tik Tok and then maybe isn't as good down the line
Honestly I really liked it
oooh Iâve been curious abt it since they changed things up but havenât talked to anyone whoâs been there yet
Also we went to parachute hi fi for dinner. Definitely recommend
That guy seriously sucks
No but me and Kari saw Nosferatu last night
Did anybody else get tickets for The Brutalist at Music Box today?
You are beautiful and majestic
That demands a certain curvature
I donât think you have that vibe
So esoteric but so accurate
Got called a humpty dumpty ass looking bitch lol
so chilling in front for like an hour rn
at coleâs and hosting old style
Anyone at Coleâs?
That would be sick!
Actually letâs get him in here!
Yeah watching WGN news before school was huge and I always loved the guy
Sorry I spoke ill of him
Tbh anyone whoâs job it was to show highlights of Devon Hester running back touchdowns I would have liked
He did a show with Shaq
I used to watch him everyday before 5th grade on WGN
Idk I didnât watch the 20 min set he did up top his voice was giving me a headache
Did he do his trans material
Hey! Just popping in to say I would truly LOVE to participate in all the upcoming bday get-togethers and events but Iâm trying to be sober for a period so I just have to kind of cloister myself away until it takes. Have fun everyone and HBD!!
Let's have a mid off
Mid jans rise up
Birthday mergers seem like the way to go now
@Bruce Kesselring karaoke collab?
Also while weâre hating I need to say how much I hate Pat Tomasuloâs vibe
I did three shows there this summer (over ten mins) and still have not been paid for any of them â¤ï¸
They'll cut people's time night of too. It's bananas
If they give people 8 it counts as a first set then they don't pay you
To do that
That's literally an item on their menu
he didnât even buy a drink
and then danny got really anxious and handed him 20 dollars and ran out
Lmao
last show i did there danny came and he didnât know about two drink minimum and matt stiuso made him feel like he was robbing the god damn place
I do too it's a weird place
itâs just weird!!! i feel weird all the time w LF!!
iâm sorry i was out of line
Woah woah woah letâs not get crazy here
and then they gave me the two extra min
and i said ok im not doing it
and then they said sorry itâs just u have to put in ur dues
and i said that makes me feel weird bc im lowkey so much funnier than vik pandya
and they gave me two min less than the entire lineup
Is it just a slideshow of laugh factory white guys holding the mic
last year they asked me to do drag and i said iâm not drag
they literally hate booking me for halloween but do it every year
then whoâs driving the plane
You two are probably the scariest ones
Thatâs fucked up
COINCIDENCE?? i THINK NOT
and the two comics they didnât include are me and derry queenâ¦.
iâm doin laugh factory halloween show and they made this video promo of the lineup
Who mid jan

Thanks for the bday wishes! Hope to see y'all on Saturday for me and Jonah's bday swoiree
in this sense crushes is a very cool place for us to tell Adam we don't love him anymore (this is the theme to his going away party that he requested)
Crushes this week is a haunted house idk if you heard
"Hey everyone. I'll send more info but Clare and I are planning on a going away get together Sunday in Lincoln park around 11/12 then heading to alive one before, during, and after crushes"
Happy birthday ianimal

Ty Richie

"Yeah chicago bath house, i might go all the time"

"I just remembered that in Arkansas kids got paddled at school when they were bad and then I looked up the state Wikipedia and it mentions how thatâs still a thing there. Did anyone elseâs schools do this? It never happened to me, but I had tons of friends who it happened to"
hbd kid!!!

Happy birthday Ian E
Dude I hate my job but this creamer makes such incredible iced coffee
wait idk if I told anyone but my old boss at the documentary job is basically making no money from documentaries and I guess his scheme to get out of this mess is that he wants to open a sauna in Hyde Park bc thereâs a lot of politicians down there (and maybe like through that gain access or clout or blackmail from them idk??) which is like the funniest and probably least efficient way of making money
No wires in da foreskin
Just a little insider knowledge
Thereâs a cold plunge in there so everyoneâs wieners get small af
damn wish I was a dude so I could hold business meetings in a sauna to make sure no oneâs wearing a wire ðð maybe in the next life
Yeah it's fellas only
happy bday @Ian Erickson !!!

We're doing dinner and then karaoke after

Everyone was so down

"To people who live the grind lifestyle, Coleâs is home"
It's good
Whatâs the Coleâs situation
OH I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GO HOME?????
I am now en route to Cole's
We are cleaning up a bunch of spaghetti and then I'm gonna roll over there
It's a great vibe at coles

Who's going to Cole's tonight after their lendermans and their agents of chaos and there one liner competitions
Hahahahahahahah
Id emplore you to consult a logical flow diagram of hegelian dialectics before you utter any more strawmans against my character
Hmmm methinks I detect some akashtic rhetoric
"yeah maybe the argument doesnât hold water because itâs an argument, not a cup"
anyone think of this yet?
M-They Genderman
Texted you
Does anyone have sageâs number? Trying to let her know I canât drop off the grimace costume
but alas
I wish I didn't sell my moped
I just zipped past all the traffic going to the thrift store next to lincoln lodge
My lil ebike moped deal is so FUCKING sick
I would have if @Caroline Twyman didn't FUCKING SABOTAGE ME
Youâd think so but at my first customer service job Elizabeth Warren did kill a guy because he forgot to cancel a personâs subscription
he lives in Washington state I don't even get the connection
obviously sharing because of the inexplicable Liz Warren reference
IDK just doesn't really hold water
Calling someone a chicken shit and then your big threat involves Liz warren
She works for him
That guy is Liz warrens boss
Oh that's right
Wait what's the part about Liz warren
Mike May just be getting his next box of Tiege Hanley
I bet you win the whole damn thing in fact!
"Ha, good luck pal, I doubt it!"
Im trying to get knocked out of the zinger tournament early so i can come see
If that makes anyone wanna stop by
The punishments this month are a delightful combination of literary and pop culture references meshed with the absurd
damn since when did kpd get woke
Some poor dude is literally in a trial somewhere and doesn't know where his lawyer is
"""OK guys, I should go"""
HAHAHAHA
Wait Kristi you should do a character called Cuban Joe
kpd going epic libtard mode
I actually think this is going to be our best show yet
Adrienne and I are going!
agents of chaos is so fucked
UGH WE'RE COMPETING WITH THE ONE LINER COMP AND MJ LENDERMAN
anyone going to mj lenderman tn
It taste unfathomably awful
It might be Kristi coded to drink it on stage
Have you ever drunken the diarrhea stuff they make you consume the night before the procedure
"""my shit will reach across the aisle!"""
Who says politicians can't reach across the aisle?
And guess what? Ultimately we all eat and shit the same food into the same places
"Wokeman deipede

^^^definitely something there"
I'll admit that I wrote that like weeks ago when I watched human centipede for the first time
I feel like it's time for a HUMANE centipede....
Now I'm just in free flow idea state but what if the middle centipede gets a Michelin star
someoneâs dad made that
bc itâs like she DOES exist
i love nepo baby human centipede
I waited in line for the midnight release
what if the front and back of the centipede are candidates for president and the middle is an undecided voter
You want to make a name for yourself on your own and create the human millipede
And you guys do human centipede two-prov
Or instead of a fade to black Beckett does a run-cut in front of you improv style but he's a human centipede too
And then you and the other two centipedes exchange glances and laugh black out
"""IDK I just feel like between these two candidates either way I'm gonna be eating shit"""
Topical!
One of the centipede is a Republican one is a Democrat and youre an undecided voter
Like super sweet sixteen but your an inhuman monster
And youâre like a spoiled rich girl who doesnât like this human centipede because it only has three segments
But they want to stay in the centipede
i feel like i need more of a take on it
Human centipede polycule but one of the people in the centipede either isn't in the polycule or wants out
Your dad could be giving it to you as a birthday gift
like so what i make out w my dad then? and then we just say and scene?
i just think itâs like ok i make a human centipede but then where do we go from here
They finally invented shy porn bots
Maybe come back when you have some clout leonard
Meggie Gates was human centipede for halloween one year. You can ask them how they did it
I actually had the idea to do that before the movie
Human centipede would be legendary Kristi
I think that might be easier to set up than a human centipede production but it seems like that a lot of your ideas are bending towards HC so if you can find a way to get that in the mix you gotta go for it
And you could have Becket play any number of characters
And then you can act out what's going on inside your colon
You could put like a hose in your or someone else's mouth and say that's a camera
"Nice try, my kid is named Aspergerâs"
What did it give him?
It gave your kid Autism what?
theyâre kinda gay but itâs def a fun show and a very easy space to go gross intense
"Dude, it gave my kid autism, not worth it"
itâs that show yuck thatâs like â yeah weâre fucked up and gross but pls wear a maskâ
"Can u give more context on ""colonoscopy show"""
Oh is the new booster out
or i could just do stand up
or admit that my dad made human centipede and iâm a nepo baby and beckett plays my dad and he makes me do one last human centipede and then me and beckett fuck on stage
kind of like unedited footage of a bear vibe
should i do a pepto bismo commercial where i drink an entire jug of pepto and shit physical bricks
snd i wanna do a human centipede bit so bad but i fear thatâs a whole production
and i have too many ideas
iâm doing a colonoscopy show on saturday
i need help w a bit
Just one full day/night?
Fucked me up for a day too
12 hours straight at least
New Covid booster is giving me such a bad headache
Who is this Zumiez diva????
He got that shit ON
Your son in 5 years
I really thought I had that shit on
Wanna see something funny
Him saluting to this is so fucking funny
Song is BY the January 6th Prison Choir
Hahahahahahahaha
Knew he was out there still
Just helped a guy named Fidel Castro pay his rent
Heartbreak Kid is also awesome
Heartbreak kid on 35mm is huge though. Itâs currently only available to watch on some random YouTube channel
Two bangers!!
Oh we just watched a new leaf and Mikey and Nicky recently
"https://musicboxtheatre.com/series-and-festivals/dangerous-business-elaine-may-matinees

Important"
We were so close!
Ugh if only we'd hosted for a whole additional year
@Bruce Kesselring if only we were Vouch certified hosts
I owe everything to that show
Hahahaha
Watch there be some private event they didn't tell the hosts about
Vouch is at lotties tn
or know anyone with a cot?
does anyone have a cot?
"Just when he gets ahead, they change the finish line ð"
Hahahahahaha furious that he can't game the pizza system
Yeahp
Hahahahahahaha is this really the doctor of laughter?
This was kinda mean of me :(
Doctor of laughter is a wrathful man
@Ian Molnar I feel like you camp
Does anyone have a cot we can borrow?
Ethan Masters has the pig
This is going to be so special
Face paint and all
I also have a oompa loompa costume
Already texted you a pic of my prop closet
Itâs from this wacky website called x.com
"Imagine Grimace, the sloppy Sundays pig and the penis all doing the monster mash at AliveOne"
omg can i hazzz cheezburger
Inflatable Penis costume!!!
but we have a rich mind
we dont have a budget
We really need the community to come together for this
were doing a haunted house lol
anyone got any crazy hallowwen costumes/// suits we can use for halloween crushes
Lol you haven't been filling out your ballot with check marks this whole time have you?
"Finally, a perfect show"
Oh nvm not yet but soon
Detroiters is on Netflix
Also hereâs my keys baby
I apologize if I made it seem there was zero growth
Iâm gonna be racist but kill myself
But he did give him a car
Gran Torino is one of the funniest movies in the world because he just wrote a movie where he says a bunch of slurs and is still racist at the end
Watched Gran Torino in a high school class called Minority Studies taught by a white guy
I havenât seen it but itâs the only one that Iâm interested in
I know thatâs a silly question
Is it genuinely a fun watch?
The only Clint Eastwood movie Iâm interested in is The Mule where he plays a drug mule and has a threesome and it came out when he was 88 years old
Clint Eastwood plays the funniest gruff asshoke with a heart of gold every single film heâs in
I liked it
Watched million dollar baby for the first time
Vegan gas
No it's E85
"What's his real last name, Unleaded?"
Turns out his real name is just Mark
I used to think Vin was short for Vincenzo
Lol I forgot that's my nickname
Been wanting a reason to force this pic into the chat
ð
I went to a fast and furious filming location in malibu
He's done everything in his power to seem italian
lmao I didn't even think about that
That is very fair
You thought a man whose most famous character is named Dominick Toretto was Italian?!?
That is an italian man
I was confident
"Like, until this year"
Have I told this chat that I thought Vin Diesel was italian?
Itâs so sick to double down on him in a city full of famous Italians
"Not to sound like a massive shill, but saying you introduced the wheel to anyone is kind of absurd"
This is so funny coming from a museum
I discover da America !
Also mentioned how he never owned slaves and adopted an indigenous child and itâs likeâ¦he just got a slave?
"I was outside of the Italian American museum (closed smh) and they had a sign with facts about Columbus and one was âintroduced wheel to western hemisphereâ and the last was âarrived in word of human sacrifice, cannibalism, and slaveryâ"
good morning chat
HELLLLL NO
IM A YOUNG ASS BITCH
KEEPS MY ASS YOUNG AS HELL
Whats that thing do?
FOREVER YOUNG
UGH I gotta
Oh I didn't even THINK about it!!!!
Are you gonna endorse Ms Bean
Romanian power fantasy
That company name is just too close to diddler
Jolly Queen
âIt was a violent journeyâ
Columbus Day is really funny
"Damn, SUPREME getting wild with the merch"
That's next weekend
Is this from the world pinball tournament
These Italians love Christopher Columbus
Crushes: pods
should we go to sleep deprivation pods
why would she ruin a local mainstay
LOL
Itâs kind of a bummer because I wanted to get massaged by a Bulgarian
Itâs the massage place where you can pick the race of your angel
Conan is putting in so much work
FBI
Is this the massage place or something different
One of the moms in my neighborhood is looking to bust this sex shop near my apartment
Anything but that ð
Yeah I'd hate to go blessed mode
But I like the idea of him going rogue and really speaking truth to power on the show
Kenan will always have work
every time he thinks about quitting he thinks about where Kel has ended up
he clearly knows his career has nowhere to go but down post SNL
I wouldn't ask any questions if I were Kenan Thompson
I once saw him walking around drunk on the ice at 30 Rock just hitting anybody that tried to get near him
Let him say the stuff theyâre too scared to say
I wish they would finally get out of kennans way
ð
AI rather have a beer than watch that
Snl AI?
I assume it's because they have to appeal to so many people but it really feels so one dimensional like it's trying to optimize for search results
"oh, uhm..."
"yeah, i always get sad seeing keenan thompson get held back by that show"
when they make the squirm do normal comedy im likeâ¦. ok? let her rip
and they think they need to address it
and i donât like watching the funniest person in my eyes do like a lame sketch it makes me sad
stuff just builds up
I feel like it's gotta all be because of the summer break?
the bachelor espresso sketch was soâ¦. odd
snl does feel ai !!
Iâll never figure it out ð
There's a difference between joking on and joking about
Oh yeah for sure
"Yeah, i'd say just don't punch down"
"But it is interesting, lots of wild stuff"
Iâd have to say I work in traditional apartments I guess
Everyone wants me to write jokes about it lol but I feel weird writing jokes about the people who live in section 8
Is it helping your art????
This place you're working at sounds so incredible
Hahahahahahahaha
They made this last week while it was still PEAK brat summer!!!!
"I talked to the husband, then the wife tried to talk to me, and then the husband again but this time with the wife just screaming In the background"
And these people are freaking out
The housing complex I work for is doing renovations
What did I miss?
Renovation company?
I just spent 15 minutes on a call explaining to people that the renovation company was not doing voodoo on me and let me just say they never believed me
https://youtu.be/fTXMjrRZago?si=KmX-UbzQmXxPftBM
"No, give an example"
Has anyone been watching snl at all? Some of these sketches feel ai generated
Iâm good for awhile
Full freezer from da aldis shutting down by my work
Damn did u hear salt shed got rabies now
Weird Al style
Jeff tell Frankie to cover one of their songs
Looks like they also edited the original caption so Jeff is featured more prominently
I mean the Frankie connections were just right there
The fact they make stuff for emo kids tho
Oh damn we put all of our honesty and truth into music so we cant really bring that into other aspects
Integrity isn't like a finite source like
Well also do to something where you just steal a comedy video premise and beats word for word for the sake of your Instagram band page... I can't imagine they have too much integrity in their other endeavors
"Just listened to the band and it makes sense they steal content, the original stuff they make is bad"
lol
The important thing is I achieved an arbitrary moral victory that I set for myself.  And I am now in the good graces of the next big emo pop band
Like itâs ok that we stole this because we admitted it
"If they happened to come up with a similar concept thatâs one thing, but tagging you and using the same lines is crazy"
Only loose end to tie up is making sure they're embarrassed
I said they didnât have to so long as they made the credit more prominent because from talking with them I donât think they had malice and I also feel like the premise itself is somewhat low hanging so I donât feel that much ownership to begin with. If I were them I would be embarrassed to have it up but they can do as they please
idk if Iâm dumb for thinking that because theyâre musicians they donât know you canât do covers for comedy?
So these guys got the dm and didnât take the video down??
Let's all dress up like Frankie but with guy Fawkes masks
Let's do dumb viral death grips shit in their pit
i hate them
that makes sense bc theyâre bottoms
Letâs picket
They're playing bottom lounge november 22
Yeah the really annoying part of this is you also cannot discredit the idea that they are just super fucking dumb and didn't realize what they did was wrong or bad
@Jeff Braun now they're cribbing inspo from your favorite movie???
truthfully iâd be more mad that theyâre gay as fuck
I'm going to keep being mean until something else happens
Dear lord
thatâs enough from the bullshit pop punk factory for the day
Nah I'm going deep now
I'm going to bed see you guys tomorrow
Hell I'm calling it a day now
as long as someone today learned a lesson i can sleep tonight
They responded to DM kindly as well. I think they meant no harm and are just hacks which is fine. They learned a lesson which is more important
I would be mad @Jeff Braun
It is kind of wild
Their parents must be very rich to afford doctors who could figure out a claim of neurodivergence here
I hope they feel piled on to
Had to add on to your comment ian
That perfectly solves everything
They pinned a comment crediting me. Gotta chalk that up as a victory imo
Next they're be stealing retribution
Would be so funny if they started doing Frankie stuff next
As of now Iâve gotten 0 follows
I did dm them turns out I had to follow
jeff let us know how many follows u get from this clip
I know we're in the middle of hating just wanted to say
The new Zelda is really really good
They're kind of famous for being unique and original
soooooo embarrassing
god i hate pop punk emo people
Some people never grow out of the repeating something funny they heard phase
It's just bc of the joke in the caption
Like Jeff at least put on scrubs and pretended to be a doctor
Also like what is even the context that they're doing this bit
they look gay
yeah also theyâre gay
Really? I'm having a hard time
God I can tell these guys suck so much
ð«¡
Reporting them for hate speech
Unleash the army
Wait I canât message them because they donât follow me lol fuck them
There's not a single clip of their music it's all engagement farming bullshit
Maybe they were on a social media post deadline and just needed to submit something and they misremembered and thought they came up with this idea
We don't really know what they're going thru where they felt like the need to do this
Eh fuck it Iâm gonna DM em
They seem like really good guys
"""Fwankie sent me hewe and is  fweatening viowence"""
Im teetering on just DMing them. I feel strong in my principles but kinda doubt anything of consequence will happen either way in which case maybe not worth the like emotional expenditure
"""hey this is just a @Jeff Braun video"""
The musicians that do shit like this are always big fucking hacks
Jeff do want us to comment on your behalf?
Summon the frankiebots
Get the Frankie army on them
u know what i hate them
yeah bc how many people are even looking at the caption that says this is jeffâs idea
I donât think I would have enjoyed it but I wouldnât have any like moral qualms with it since it would be obvious they were referencing something whereas here they are playing in tbe gray area that they might have come up with it
I say call them out
Yeah fuck them
Oh ya I just looked at the follower count
would u have been down for it if they just lip synced it
I have been waiting for some kind of emo equivalent to having health insurance
Oh for sure yeah i mean it's just straight up stealing but doing the bare minimum minor effort to make it technically not
"itâs annoying bc they also have a lot
of
followers and think they can get away w just saying follow jeff and assuming youâll be ok w it"
Start a dialogue!
Or better yet turn it in to content
Eric Sony and Hypnosis unpinned a message.
I would dm them and make them feel bad
Eric Sony and Hypnosis pinned a message.
Exactly. And I feel in my heart of hearts they know this and are using it to their advantage
You can still say that now and be like I don't like this but they have like a dumb argument back or slight ammunition to respond against
Like if they didn't credit you you would have complete footing to say take his down
But I have seen this where people just straight up steal shit. And they did the absolute bare bare bare minimum to credit you instead of straight up steal stuff so you can't really do anything about it without maybe coming off as a buzz kill
literally
Aldis closing by my work
Yeah it's also weird considering Tik Tok has set a precedent where you can just directly lip sync over something
And they lift lines directly so itâs like not quite a lip sync not quite oc
I think you should cover one of their songs
but itâs annoying and weird
they def thought they were like being respectful by doing that i think??
Which is intentional imo
soooo awkward
oh damn they tagged u in it
In between promoting their song and saying theyâre neurodivergent
They credit you but itâs like buried in the caption?
So weird
i would send them ur reel
i just saw someone copy a chris fleming video on tiktok and go viral yesterday and it was so annoying
oooooo so weird
Note they did not reach out to me in anyway before posting
https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBEpD7ix4BN/?igsh=MW80amM1Z3o4NnIy
Curious what yall would do in this situation
imma hit it up if anyone is interested ð¤
pylon is playing at bric a brac at 2
Of an otherwise genius idea
Question mark in the concept makes me doubt the source
Could be a great opportunity
Bobby was mid sentence ranting about Chicago cross streets some reason
They immediately got out of the car while saying thank you and goodbye
"While driving Bobby and Paul home yesterday, we were at a red light and Paul saw a liquor store and told Bobby âwe should get out and get beer.â"
What a wild show
All of these women are in danger lmao
And the camera pans to some Funko pops
"And he was like, ""these figurines, I get one everywhere I go"""
Hahahahahahahaha this dude just showed his fiance his house
Forget those bitches
Turning off Gilmore girls
Ok I will watch it John!
Just say what's in your heart
How do I word an email to my uncle saying thank you for the hockey tickets and sorry if you overheard my friend Bobby screaming homo
She's just hanging out making shit toxic
It's incredible
BRO THIS ONE WOMAN WHOSE GUY LEFT IS JUST STICKING AROUND
One more is about to leave
Hahahahahahahahaha 2 of the five guys have left because the women are too independent
They are unbelievably toxic
These Kings are so toxic it's incredible
what's splatter?
THEYRE THREATING TO BEAT EACH OTHER UP
Almost died
"We were in a dining area with my uncle who got us the tickets and iâm intimidated by.

Bobby and paulie were yelling riffs"
PEOPLE ARE LEGIT FIGHTING
YOOO THIS LOVE IS BLIND IS INCREDIBLE
I was thinking of going to splatter the 26th! If anyone wants to wait and go see it
MARRIED KING!
My brother!
Who got married?
THAT KICKS ASS
Good for him
Found out the brideâs dad got a handy under the table at the wedding
Some of these dudes are scary
Lmao
And people living in Dubai
It's all in Dubai
"Yo I'm watching Love is Blind - Habibi, it's so good"
Hahahahhaahha
love him
Exact perfect person to do that with
It starts at Steppenwolf time
So Iâm chillin at home unless someoneâs cooking up something good
Me too same I thought it was at like nine
See that was my plan but then o found out it starts in 10 minutes
Are people going to Splatter tonight?
Itâs full Springsteen but for just Cleveland
"Cleveland has a legit local Springsteen called Michael Stanley Band, look up the song My Town"
It's a good idea in theory
The Springsteen-Jersey connection simply does not exist for most places
I like the idea that every place has a springsteen tho
Bruce is a unique case though
Smashing Pumpkins and John Prine were good too
Ideally it would be a musician but I think we are discovering chicago doesn't have one
Andrew quit teaching to become an infographic pollster
Plain White Tâs is also Chicago suburbs but theyâre one trick ponyâs. But Delilah is like our Springsteen Wendy
Yeah so it turns out you werenât looking for a musician
Both good choices
Bill Murray maybe more so now
Honestly yeah
John Belushi
I think more in terms of universally beloved
Both of those answers are lame for different reasons though
If we are talking Springsteen levels of influence it is either Kanye or Muddy Waters
ðªº
Yeah that was the only thing
I couldn't get laid bc he was fucking all the girls My age :(
"Peet ""Wentz"" and got so much pussy"
anytime someone said they didnât like woody allen she would just get so upset and walk away
You were right!
"In middle school I was like ""peet Wentz must get so much pussy"" lol"
Thatâs what Iâm saying
I agree
Pre-reunion falloutboy rocks
Wait what
I might fuck around and watch this tn
i neeeed a movie night for it it was sooo bad
paris manhattan
"Not anti pre reunion fallout boy, just not stoked theyâre the biggest"
This ain't a scene is literally about my life
What was it called
I will defend fallout boy the bass lines are so fucking tight
def want to watch this w the crew
and then a robber came in and he had a gun to her head and she handed him a dvd of Manhattan and he decided not to rob her anymore
My queen
"Fuck it, Led Zepellin"
and hand them annie hall
hereâs the medicine u need
sheâd be like
and anytime someone was like i have a fever and the chills
saw a movie on the plane that was all about a girl who runs a pharmacy who is obsessed w woody allen
Oh I mixed it up with fallout boy nvm
Jolly beans Christmas album will rival all
The band Chicago and Styx are too
"John prine, disturbed, and Green Day are Chicago alum"
which was a bottle a night girlð¤ð¤
decided iâm either going sober or fully drinking like i did in fwance
also just got home
The problems are that all of these people moved away
theyâre literally from my suburb
itâs fall out boy
ohhhh yeah
If we're going movies id say Michael mann
Oh wait it unfortunately may be Fall Out Boy
Joe Swanberg
Right well it's a tough question bc if u said chance like 6-7 years ago you'd be right but I feel like he's frittered away a lot of influence and good will
chance is he wasnât gay
Yeah Wilco is the biggest I think as far as rock goes
Chance maybe
i feel like he doesnât count
Ya or I was gonna say Kanye potentially
this^^
Honestly? Our Springsteen is Chief Keef
Smashing Pumpkins are great
Like tweedy is maybe the biggest guy who lives here right?
Idk there are people who are popular/influential from Chicago but don't necessarily like live here or operate from
Yes
Music?
Like how Jersey has Springsteen
Who is the best regional artist for Chicago
it cute
anyone watch da new dragon ball yet?
@Ian Erickson plz let us know about next time
"I was too worn out from work to go, so stoked for future Ian dj parties"
Ian DJ'd amazingly it was a banger party
Had a dream I went to see Ian DJ ð
Did we talk about this
my gorgeous solitude in france has been one for the books but i am coming home ready to grab a beer with my pals
brb flying home
Also if anyone is coming tonight it's BYOB
I like the Ari remix but not enough gun lyrics
Hot take: club classics is my fav on the remix
My dad called me and my brotherâs wedding speech âlong windedâ letâs goooo
That's the type of vibe and positive energy that's contagious
Letsgooo
Waiiit I wanna see Ian dj and that place is right by my apartment
In numerology it means good dj
Maybe 2629
I think 2625 n central park was my first address in chicago
Wait
Maybe especially that
Even the hieroglyphic stuff
I like bon iver
It's at 2625 n central park ave
Yeah the lineup is me
Where is it? The website is being goofy for me
Do you have an idea when youâll be on the lineup?
"Omg that Once soundtrack was nuts, had everyone acting like they'd never heard folk music before"
Bon Iver and the soundtrack for Once
I hate Bon Iver my mom got super into him after her divorce
Just like since his second record nothing he's done has excited me
It's not that I think he's bad
The Ari song is the best one
I love bon ivers stupid ass
Sorry joining discourse late but I think Ariana grande song is boring
Charlis verses are good but I feel like he weighs them down
Jonah we need to talk about this cuz I agree
Itâs like they did the 360-> 365 thing for every song on the album itâs so sick
Brat continues to give can't remember the last time I feel like a record got so much milage and i do love it everytime
Outshines the original mix in many instances
But I love their friendship
I just can't get into bladee
Amazing album
donât forget bladee
Yung Lean really surprised me to he's great on it
tbh i havenât given anything a listen but i donât expect anything groundbreaking
And I like charli thinking about having a kid in the middle of her coke album
Noo Charlis verses were even better this time around
Yeah I think they're trying to get stuff off the ground they did a comedy show last week
Sorry but he has to do more that throw some some blown out autotune on a track to impress me
WTF do they run shows there?
It's one of the few where I think the original is way better and it doesn't even come close
I just really don't think he contributes anything good
But I understand the mid allegations
I disagree
I think the Bon Iver Charli track might be best on the album.
Caroline polachek is kind of aping Kristi/brigid notes app poetry in her feature bc she says âfree bleeding in the autumn breezeâ
But Volcano Choir was good I'll give him that
I just mean i think he's mid in general
havenât listen to new charli
idc about him!
Bon Iver is mid tbh
yes
Can I give a hot take?
The Ariana Grande feature is everything I wanted it to be
Elliot gb and Bennets place on n central park
This looks sick
Where are you at again?
Honestly gonna be a fun set up they're gonna move the pews out of the way
How much time should I expect to do on this Braided show?
it's so good
ðªº
Anyone want to talk about how sick the brat Remix record is?
Come have a beer and hang out
Not sure how they are handling this but it's free

Jeff must be so good at talking to kids about santa claus
so there really has not been any continuity errors in the Kristi/Joey breakup of 2024
yes that is the explanation
The name Kristi Durkin is like a doctor who thing so Frankie actually has that email address now. So Iâve been told
Delete this
Why is Kristi on this email ?? When Frankie is the new host
Ln I got stoned and kept saying this guyâs name aloud
The joke makes even less sense tweeted when heâs saying it it at least kind of sounds like hurricane
"Here I am, rock me like a Burger King"
Hahahahahaha alpha move
not loving this!
guy at airport playing piano wearing a sweater of a plane going down in flames

Wow carworld guy would fit right in at quora
Can we confirm this intel
"Wait I am sorry I was OOO on a bike ride, but is the William Banks jail sentence really fake and for a bit?"
The thinking manâs Yahoo Answers
I love Quora
lmao i just realized this was the op
"I think what I say about John is fluid and Richie is trying to crystalize my words, which is very akashtic, which I am choosing to believe (spiritual) is a negative thing"
I would never say that but Ian did
John you are basically a loser every day is what Ian is saying
But
Might go later! But
John I'll make it up to you I'll take you to any mic in the city next week
I wouldnt say just this week
No
Am I just the fucking rube this week

Hahaha yeah
Can u pull up this guy's post history
Hahahahahaha the reference to (science)
Only akredit
No we no longer accept akash here
any more akashicly spiritual criticisms of me? (edited)
anymore akashicly spiritual criticisms of me?
Do you think this guy has ever considered how smart he is?
is everyone all caught up
and the mistake of erroneously declaring it an accident
i made the mistake of replying to someone on quora
Deeply spiritual people rarely discount historical evidences to the contrary
This doesn't seem accidental
i accidentally responded to something on quora
MAYBE to an open mic
I don't WHERE I'm bringing it
I'm taking my gun out
John hates phonies and I think he should do something about it
Lie-rish

Lame as shit
Lame
FUUUUUUCK
Are you guys feuding or something?
You didnât quit you were fired

Children can vote...They're called Republicans ð
They have the ability to democratically elect whoever they deem best to get slimed on at the Nickelodeon  kids choice awards
Children can already vote
I can prove it to you mathematically
Itâs a very uncomfortable opinion to have
If anyone could help convince me otherwise Iâd appreciate it
Just saw a tik tok where a guy convinced me that children should be allowed to vote
I always thought that was an official offshoot
u can drink on the street here!

"The real power move, delete the email never respond"
Us and sloppy Sundays Montreal are on very good terms thank you
Look at my lawyer dog I'm going to time out
"âNice to meet you, John. I agree that, given the circumstances, it would be in your best interest to change the name of your show. Have you considered the name Sloppy Sundays?â"
Great opportunity tho to introduce a new kid lawyer character into the frankiverse
"Pal, nobody is confused by that"
Truly so funny to be like âpeople will be confused by your comedy show and go there instead of our long time theatre show that is 80 blocks south of thereâ
That's like when that poke company tried to trademark the word aloha
I wonder if he's sending cease and desists to hot dog places
i've heard of headshots but this is ridiculous
Not sure if font is legible
You should do a Kanye fifty style where you both drop albums at the same time and whoever sells less quits music
Also can Frankie sign my gun
For a old style tallboy
Is it cool if I email him a picture of a gun
Change it to 50 first jokes
I think that case has wrapped up so he should be free
Yeah I know a good lawyer he just got my buddy down to 18months in jail for a hate crime
Anyone know any good lawyers I want to sue this guys ass

Where people at tonight?
Man Cole's sucked again
I needed it
Finally someone sticks up for us
"Lmao the piano guy at Cole's is roasting Victoria for saying ""another straight white guy"""
My other gun is my wry sardonic wit
Or what about
"Wow, who said art couldn't be... good?"
"You wouldn't give a kid comedian a gun, would you?"
Basically Iâm like an art guy now
Hahahahaha
Tell me itâs not worth it
No drama
PLEAS E
NOOOOOO
Wait I changed my mind Iâm gonna collage w it

"osama bin laden getting killed

Mets fans       Phillies fans

I think itâll work tbh
He needs to write letters to woody Allen for a pardon
"âSo, what are you in for?â"
no reason ððð
I'm just starting to wonder why I've never seen you and the pied Piper of Hamelin at any of the same events
He is about to get so much more religious
â¦what are you trying to say
Trying to keep things on topic
"itâs been chill, everyone Iâve talked to is seeing the humor in it, but Iâve also heard that players refuse to be featured in any in house media bc they donât want a record of being on this team lol"
Sorry I'll send that later

Also did u have a mouse or a rat at the bakery you worked at?
Is being that bad not good for morale or is everyone kinda seeing the humor in it
How are the vibes in the white Sox office btw
That mouse is gonna turn that team around!
their newest recruit ð¤©
working at Sox stadium today and thereâs a mouse in the office rn
Dude heâs gonna convert the inmates
I canât wait to not hear the words âCar Worldâ until July 2025
He's gonna make a GetHard arc 100%
He's gotta smuggle a phone in and post from prison
18 i think
Wasnât this the max sentence??
This is now high performance art
"@Aaron Klinger, father of one @Johnbo Walter Stockwell"
Preppy Aesthetic Athena? I think they might have a clue
That 11 year old has no clue how cool that is
I'd feel so special
That's sick
Hahahahaha
"Ok, meg confirmed bro?????"
To be fair she was probably acting like a bitch
Hahahahaha Hajime No Ippo seems to really have affected your life
@Caroline Twyman do you have family Florida?
Also called some lady a bitch
Went off on a nonsensical rant about how itâs dumb to hate billionaires because sometimes companies have to follow regulations and thatâs hard for them
CEO is really on one at this quarterly meeting
I am a better person now because of hajime no ippo

Boxing anime is good tho
Pat for the course named the group boxing chat.
imagine two neanderthals in neandertholithic times standing there punching each other (edited)
i would spear them both
imagine two neanderthals standing there punching each other
If I was boxing I would simply out think them. Find out what they want
"grow up. run away, subtly smear his reputation over time"
boxing is so dumb. oh this guy is about to punch me let me stand here and try to punch him.
POV ur definitely about to lose this thing
Donât worry about it actually
Kamala Harris on call her daddy code red
Watched his Dracula last night really good movie
very normal movie!
Someday I hope this whole chat becomes Megalopolis chat
Put us in the chat
@Adrienne Stout and I have seen megalopolis
Hahahahahahaha
Paul has the ability to make me feel like a child again
"when paul did that bit at schubas for the first time it was like 1am & @Aaron Klinger, father of one & I both thought we were in a fever dream"
It felt good tbh
I had a good stretch of not unsending messages
That's so good
So any time a hurricane happens he tweets Burger King *insert hurricane here*
Paul has a bit about if Burger Kings were named after Hurricanes
First time I donât understand his beauty
I wanna know so bad
Can you help me understand
Hahahaha
Lorne Michaels telling all the women on the cast to smile more
"He's like ""funny guy we just need to get him some pussy"""
Now I just keep picturing Lorne trying to turn Bowen straight
I know Lorne paid or tried to pay for Steven Castillo to get acne treatment and I think asked him to lose weight to consider adding him to the cast
i did hear something fucked up about weight stuff from lorne but idk if thatâs true either
These types of dudes just rock
I have a friend like this
no idea why he made this but it's awesome
just sent me this
This is one of the only people I talk to from high school
Could rock
Nation of Islam style
If he united the prison under one religion I think I'd have to convert too that would be really impressive
ðªº
What if car world guy goes to prison and then heavily proselytizing. So instead of people finding God in prison they find Car World. Nobody tell him this idea
Plus there's the whole Joey/Kristi feud that everyone is very invested in
Wow some really interesting stuff in here today. Down for Chinatown + karaoke
Amazing!!
Hard to get an exact headcount but I am taking the heart reacts from the last message at face value but we'll have a lil wiggle room if more folk wanna hop in
Also I don't know if we'll end up needing all of it but I just made a reservation for a private room for 13 people at Dolo Restaurant in Chinatown on Oct 26th at 7pm
To put it lightly
Don't recall exact specifics but a lot of it involves being pretty bad to women
one day I hope to prove this by gabbing with my girls while in an MRI machine
gossip is so good for your brain
And that's all I know!
And science of course
All I heard about the friend is they are non binary pretty sure not william
I fucking love gossip
The lord hath answered my prayer for a bountiful day in the chat
"I canât think of another reason she wouldâve been fired, she was doing really well on the show"
Not a bit pretty sure
Wait what's the bad stuff you hot my attention
I want that to be true so badly
Which friend because that sounds like William Banks hahahaha
Or is this a bit?
Really?
Hahahahahahahaha
Ok I overheard in LA the reason she got fired was she brought a friend to the after party and they stuck their fingers in lorne's food
The blackcent was egregious
Iâll see him occasionally but he mainly performs on the road with Chloe
I saw him a few weeks ago
As far as I can tell
Yeah heâs definitely not performing in Brooklyn anymore at least
Michael Hirsch I think
Oh ya I heard some bad stuff about him
I want more details like does he suck at comedy
who is Chloe Troast's boyfriend I only know the broad strokes
he learned it at McGill
They are keeping you safe
hahahahaha
I like to think itâs due to her boyfriend doing Blaccent
/also wanted to be famous
when I was in sixth grade in catholic school I lowkey thought god was calling me to be a saint bc I felt really bad all the time but it turns out I just had really bad anxiety ð«¶ðï¸
Do it while heâs still a free man
Yeah and I'd really like to talk to him about that
oh he would 100% start having delusions that he is a saint
Is it because of the construction?
His whole new bit is that he really believes in god
Anyone know what the deal is with all the cops in Logan Square?
Confession is lowkey kinda good for guys like that
I think he'd like it
I'd like to convert Will Banks to Catholicism
I fucked it up
UGH the bit is gone
Sorry wait Cole's?
You gonna be at crushes?
just chillin before dinner decided to check in on the chat â¤ï¸
iâm gone this week!
no!
HAHAHA
Are you back in town crusty?
What if this is the reason Chloe Troast got fired from SNL lmao. She has the car world tattoo and they were like âyeahhh we gotta let you goâ
i also wonder how much he cares about politics vs doing this new character tbh
haahahahahahaha
I was told heâs dating a 21 year old Kennedy now so maybe heâs got their machine behind him
but also itâs like idk donât date william banks tbh hahahaha
i bet caro feels realllllly weird
Looooool
Hard to do the âcountry not religionâ argument even though itâs true
Oh shit thatâs right
"Yeah I was going to say, this could be tried as a hate crime lol"
https://www.thehour.com/news/article/westport-israel-flags-stolen-colony-road-december-18693389.php
Ok going back to work sry for caffeine spamming
Just the worst person to support
Israeli flags which is good
What signs did he rip out in Connecticut?
Nvm
"Doing a photo shoot in a kimono, gonna hold a sign saying this"
"Also idc, it funny"
When I go to Japan I wanna do a bit where I keep saying this is the only place I feel safe as a Jewish man
Something similar
in 1984 I was jailed for stealing yard signs ð¶ðµ
Jewish improv troupes are gonna get your ass
I think so
Still thinking about this sry
"itâs very Manson of him, good for the cult vibes"
They were all Israeli flags right?
To the community
"That felt mean, my apologies"
Starting JailWorld
Jewish prison gangs are gonna get his ass
wait I thought it was it downstate illinois
"Canât be too worried, he still posted about the improv jam he hosts tonight"
He used to yell at his son until he would live in our basement every now and then
It would be a respectable way to have to go to jail Kerry is right
"Heâs being vague, idk!"
They must have all gotten together and sued him? Like why is it going to âtrialâ does he mean local Connecticut court
This feels like a Noah Kahan lyric
Drove in my hometown and saw an old friends dads truck
"Yeah i think it probably would, but thatâs still just wild to even go to court for that"
but that would kind of rule if he went to jail
esp if 18 months is like the max
I feel like the sentence could be lessened to like a fine or community service
"@Aaron Klinger when youâre not busy unconditionally loving your son, I wrote an essay about your question"
if he acts like William Banks in the courtroom they will def make an example out of him
Right!
Bit
But
"Like, that feels like it should be more of a âdonât do that againâ thing"
"I do believe itâs true, but that seems like not a trial worthy crime? Like wouldnât that be like a misdemeanor if anything? I truly hope he has a lawyer and isnât going to represent himself for the big"
Watching his life unfold makes me wondering if this is how people felt about Andy Kaufman doing his shit
It does feel insane to go to jail for taking signs from peopleâs yards
itâs like truly bravo level crazy
i loveeeeeee any william banks updates
He had a partiful link in his story for people who wanted to come support him at the trial and that feels wild to me
But if not true? Even crazier
Very crazy if true
"Iâm not sure if itâs a bit but I donât think it is, William Banks is being charged and going to trial tomorrow for ripping all of those signs out in Connecticut tomorrow and the Max penalty is 18 months"
Easter is on 4/20 next year
I mostly use mine for magic and emulators though but I did play a lot of kingdom hearts on it and that was fun
I gotta get the dock
I have the dock tho so some elden ring on the big screen
Lots of balatro
Haven't used it a ton recently
What have you been enjoying playing on steam deck? Kinda looking for some recs
No

Yeah
Do you have a steamdeck??
Pfh owned
If it makes you feel better there were only like 5 people
Iâm home now. The mic was 2 hours ago
Show proof
No like unplayable
WHAT THE FUCK
Tv is cool
John it wasnât cancelled we were just like 2 doors further back
I'm sorry
You're right ð
What do you know
But I wouldn't recommend playing a competitive shooter with a controller
I'm sure it does
Do u know if deadlock works on steamdeck
Is there a Monday mic worth doing?
Anybody doing any mics?
Lmao I guess it's cancelled
Going to diversy river bowl for some punishment
It's ur birthday 2023?
So fun
Also literally my birthday 2023^
I have a friend in town but they love those things so I'm a maybe

"WAIT IS IT OFFICIAL, IS FRANKIE THE NEW COHOST?!"
i think she is trying to understand how to vote
He told my cat by the door to âheelâ
ð¡ (out of town ð)
Polish repair is over for a toilet leak. He shook the toilet and went âstrongâ
I already have dinner party plans for that night ð
Heart reacted too quick I'm gonna be out of town ð
"But honestly, the schools on the Northside of the city are on the whole better than where I teach in NYC"
And it seems like part of the issue is that covid funding is expired which leaves the district with a big deficit that will force cuts so I think there's a way it would get more money to the city? Idk that's been an ongoing problem since may
But a big issue in Chicago is the school board is appointed and if Brandon replaces all of them it would be a decent stopgap while the seats start opening up for election
Unfortunately I'm a little put of the loop on the specifics of what's happening with Pedro and the board rn but the Trib is a conservative paper and the subreddit is full of people from the burbs that don't even live in the city
"I think things always get heated around the end of the contract, but the unionâs demands are usually pretty reasonable.

Iâd have to know a bit more about what sheâs confused on."
"Sorry to spam the chat but me and Jonah are thinking of planning a joint bday venture on Saturday Oct 26th. 

We are thinking of grabbing a succulent Chinese meal in beautiful historic Chinatown and then maybe renting a room for karaoke?

Heart react if you think you are definitely down for dinner and karaoke, thumb up if you are interested or just would do karaoke. Angry react if you are out for both"

Elephantnda Room
I think it did change the brain enough to where you can intentionally try to introduce new thinking patterns but I found the actual experience to be horrifying to the point where if Iâd smell something that smelled like the doctors office I would think of vomit
Dream night at the club
"I found the experience to not be great, I got violently high and puked while a psychiatrist talked to me"
The goal is to get a more objective perspective on trauma and increase Neuroplasticity since the effects kinda linger in your brain
"I went in twice a week where they would do nasal spray or injections and you would trip balls in a room where thereâs dim lights, trippy stuff playing, and a puke bucket"
There was a time in Illinois where insurance covered intensive ketamine therapy
@Andrew Shankland @Luke Ipsum  how do I articulate to a friend why Chicago Reddit hates the teachers union?
I'm messing with mirage a bit
Almost exclusively
I've been playing Warden and Viscous kind of frequently

I had it mailed to me but the tablets kinda sucked I think you want that shit in your veins
I think I'll be a lil more experimental/ try some new stuff at this one but take more of a banger-oriented approach to DJing after the witches of Eastwick show next Saturday
Also if you wanna do indoor ketamine dance therapy this Friday I'm DJing at Elliot and Bennets place
I know there's people who do it at clubs but is it really a dance drug?
So theoretically you could go dancing
I watched over Bruce a couple times when he tried it at home
Or are there take home options
Do you have to do k therapy at a doctorâs office
Driving now but yes
Expand on this experience
@Henry Toups lunch queue?

Therapists would come in and talk to you while you were in a k hole

LANDLORDS ARE PEOPLE TOO!!!!!!
THE REIGN OF TERROR IS OVER
LUCIA TALKED TO HER LANDLORD
When south park makes me laugh it is harder
It's all kind of referential
Also family guy is funny but theres a kind of one note feeling about all the jokes
I kept laughing into mind of mencia
The al Qaeda cartoon at the end where everyone is eating poop made me laugh so hard
"South Park not always funny, frequently abhorrent but always interesting"
Great episodes. Not streaming on Max but worth going out of your way to watch
I believe an arc
It was multiple episodes*
It's curry time ð¤¤
Yeah joong bo sells lime leaves
Any reflective growth
Did anyone learn any lessons today
iâdk i think it would definitely take me 300 hours to make a 30 minute short film
"I think we have a lot of good editors in chat, i sorta wish people would post abhorrent premiere projects more often, for us to dish about"
It seems like heâs using premiere as like a graphics thing instead of after effects
The Legion is gwowing
Sam Perry says youâre awesome
@Jeff Braun just got recognized for Frankie t shirt
"bro needs to learn how to nest, that time lines a mess"
"Like why not say ""my short got accepted into a showcase"""
I mean that's what it looks like
Watch the video be like a complete mess of clips lmao
What a strange post
"I don't really know Brody, but this seems like too much lol"

Once I get my battery it's over
OH NOO thatâs the face I make huh? Was just thinking about you @Johnbo Walter Stockwell because the guy at that intersection had a regular bike that was secretly an e-bike and I was like wait thatâs the ultimate cheat
A @Maddie Daviss sighting
No worries thanks tho
Anyone interested in going to pinball fest October 18th -20th in Schaumburg?
This poll is no longer available.
I was the only one with the guts to even say anything smh
I was protecting my family
I believe Kristi
"You gotta understand, the rule was tyrannical"
interestingâ¦.
he hit me
@Kristi has something theyâd like to say to everyone
Okay weâve talked it out
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer added Kristi Durkin to the group.
For our small town it was viewed as incredibly disruptive
Our senior prank was instead of driving to school - we all biked
But it was like modular buildings with cement ground so it became an animal cruelty thing real quick
Some kids at my school tied an alligator up outside a teacher who was a big Florida gators fans classroom
I thought which way western man was just a book by a regular guy :(
I only saw the phrase âwhich holeâ
Sorry was quoting a meme I didnât even know was a nazi thing :(
Mostly just a prank on myself
I didnt walk at graduation because my final project in western culture class was a video of stick figures fucking
"yeah our senior prank was something like ""we put a pick up truck in a weird spot"" ..... no clue who the prank was on, exactly!"
We had a dude that had a truck and the back had the confederate flag with the words âraging red neckâ on it in Arkansas
But to me it sounds like hell
Always presented as some amazingly quirky thing
"This was a town of 30,000 but surrounded by smaller towns without high schools, so those kids had access"
Itâs that and like stories of people riding tractors to prom
My school had kids who wouldâve done that but most who would dropped out of high school by then
Rural high schoolers sound off
Did this ever actually happen
That but a bomb
So he spends all his time looking for pig #1 lmao ð¤£
"And label it ""pig #2"""
"Should I do the classic ""let a pig loose"""
He not here
What pranks should I pull
Bleeding radiators in my tenants apartment
"One to think, one to drink"
"One sober, one wasted ð"
Sort of the thinking manâs show
"Two shows, Iâm seeing a matinee"
"Damn msg, that's huge for them!"
"Just kidding, Brat was the straight Brat tour"
"Seeing Vampire Weekend with my brother and gf on Sunday at MSG, itâs the straight manâs Brat tour"
Showing respect
"Sorry, that I temp for"
"the company I work for bought a bunch of buildings and turned them into Section 8, theyâre doing just fine"
Ok
Phew
"The landlord is a corporation, so itâs not a big deal"
Thoughts and prayers brother
This landlord is in my thoughts
I genuinely respect the game
Itâs 7 years of not paying
He'll have a stroke
Gotta remove.john from the chat before he sees this
And also sweating from that number
Iâm straight up impressed
Just saw someone at work that owes $121000 in rent

Sorry I slept in

The bits trick me
Iâm too anxious for this playful tension
Like I hate drama truly
This poll is no longer available.
NOT trying to be dramatic
Right Iâm not opposed to adding Kristi back we just need to have a pretty difficult conversation before it happens
This poll is no longer available.
Bit*
Joey is handling that but
I bow
"Not a problem, just noticing"
Kristi still out of group I notice?
"This is all starting to begin to seem quite ridiculous, no?"
I mean
I've heard of nail polish remover but non polish remover?
This poll is no longer available.
This poll is no longer available.
I will not relinquish power
catalina wine mixer added Andrew Shankland to the group.
John do the right thing and see yourself out
Can we just stick to polish removals
I saw no other option
catalina wine mixer removed Andrew Shankland from the group.
Is Sacramento in the room with us now?
You started the witch hunt I'm taking it to its logical conclusion
Purge him
But I'm working on it now
No
Stock are you Catholic
Holiest city in California
Is Sacramento California called that because they always doing the sacrament?
Christ is in the room during the sacrament
In any case transubstantiation is true
I'm now John Grajdura
John Stockwell is a gd Mayflower name
Actually so funny for John Stockwell to remove Jonah for having too Anglo of a last name
This has sold me on Catholicism
Polish pride
Appreciate your discretion in this matter
Weâll see if Kristi does
I hope you and Jonah have learned your lessons
"Thank you for not telling that story, Richie"
I always liked Chad
I wonât even tell you guys about how my mentally challenged uncle started shouting âpolish equals stupidâ at church when the service they went to was in polish instead of English. Iâm not even going to tell that story
"Idk he was always very polished but yeah, the context of his comedy leaned towards a conservative result"
Creating fake arguments he wins with his daughters etc
"There is a genre of comedy that's like ""they said this, so I retorted with THAT"" and he's always loved that stuff"
Don't really know the context but chad daniels was always doing conservative dad comedy.  He does well live but I always thought of him as  kinda boring
Mischief Managed
catalina wine mixer added Richie Owens and Jonah Eggleston to the group.
Sorry guys I have the day off
John Paul II supremacy
Loving how safe the chat feels
catalina wine mixer removed Jonah Eggleston from the group.
We will not tolerate Polish posers
Anyone else looking to be purged in the Polish coup?
I don't have faith in this
Iâm polish
Really did not want any ugliness to spill into the chat. Iâm sorry everyone
Thank you to my ally John Walter Stockwell
catalina wine mixer removed Richie Owens from the group.
Polish hate will not be tolerated
ðððð
Wow
I could say something like âIâve got a pole for you right hereâ but I wouldnât do that
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer removed Kristi Durkin from the group.
I have made all poles in chat in charge
Johnbo Walter Stockwell added Lucia Whalen as a group admin.
Johnbo Walter Stockwell added Joey D Bednarski as a group admin.
Polish and In Charge
and polish
some of them are gay men who donât like when women are in charge
PEOPLE WE KNOW?!
Yeah some of them are conservative landlords
Like of people we know?
I think most Lincoln Lodge comedians are one bad day away from voting for Trump
itâs why i left crushes
i couldnât agree more
Unfortunately I do believe a majority of comedians are conservative
It was bound to happen
We lost a real one
Welp
I'm way too stoned for this rn
Same
I keep it in my favorites
Zako giving the bends
@Joey post the pic
Doesnât quite fit but always want a reason to use this pic
This looks like if that Radiohead album cover loved jokes about kicking dogs
Wish I saw folks like this at my shows ð
You gotta do a Frankie the kid comedian as an adult ai image
Zako being hype about this is really really funny
I truly believe this might be the creature that greets you at the gates of hell

"Iâve bought every IanIceCream drop, and the pumpkin spice might be the best one yet"
Please share your findings with the chat
Did he present?
It made me emotional
Just want to say that @Ian Erickson put on an absolute masterclass with the pumpkin spice ice cream
"tomorrow hit em with ""hullabaloo"" âcould be huge"
yeah
Kerfuffle?
as well as âbull in a china shopâ
introduced curfuffle into the office lexicon and itâs really taking off
had a big week so far
Bowser ass
They've been here all day
But the plumbers are still here
I want ice cream
FUUUUUUCK
I'm just packing up the ice cream and going to head over
Thereâs still like four more sets
Yes!
Is GEEZ still going?
Ooh possibly yes
he gave us polish beers when we signed the lease hehehehe
Viva Poloski â
â¦am I Johnâs tenant???
heâs also polishâ¦.
Sounds like a dope fella ð
he can knock on our door
he lives on the first floor
What if your landlord needs to contact you????
This is really so dangerous having your Internet out
we work in the real world
neither of us have email jobs so weâre chilling
CALL CHET!!!!!
FUUUUUUCK THIS IS AN EMERGENCY
no I had to get my haircut so I had to change my focus
Any updates on the internet situation?
yes at depaul
I could maybe be convinced to karaoke
*goodbye earl voice* Go to John Earl
I know some folks are maybe going to John Earl but I was still leaning towards Sat nite
Are folks still interested in a karaoke night this weekend?
the precursor was palestine and israel
feel bad
i acidentally made fun of my therapist for saying he wishes we can all be more costa rican like around politics
Wait you were on a college team w him
Very funny he was doing that online
during Covid a girl organized a struggle session via zoom for my college improv team bc kierron harrell wouldnât stop putting the women on the team into weird situations in the scenes he was in
I've been waiting for this moment
calling a struggle session for the groupchat
but thatâs the leftist way!!
I'll die on this land I built
No time for in fighting
"Please, Iâm canceling John"
Pergola fully repossessed
arenât you a saint
Youâre gonna get so cancelled
"I work in public housing, youâre looking bad here!!!"
"Sorry, itâs good."
Sam go hang with a hobo or whatever you do
Something we can all agree on (itâs good?
Why canât we talk about porno???
"Really good name switch gang, fully captures current chat!"
This is an emergency!!!!
"Yeah, you gotta call him!!!"
no he left me here to go play guitar lol

It's mostly fiber now
Coax cables are dead
Every time Iâve had to transfer comcast from one place to another it has been the worst
When Chet asked you to setup the internet he probably just meant he wanted you to ask him
how am I supposed to know???
"""is this a Internet?"""
Incredible exchange
Yeah see you might be set up already for 5G or fiber and can't bring Xfinity
Didnât even have to do anything when I moved. I think I could take this fucker on the road w me
I have a 5G thing and literally I just plug it into an outlet
Keep looking it gets crazy
Holy shit it has a basketball court
truuue. fiber could be major bc I love streaming and downloading!
Like fiber etc
To see if it's already set up for something
I'd look your address up on internet sites
Yeah that's gonna be unavoidable soon
the only thing is that itâs 5G so I will be transformed into a bill gates super soldier ð«¤
"not sure. Iâm trying to transfer my xfinity from my old place, but also was thinking about getting Verizon internet which doesnât need a coax connection and has a three year price lock so maybe this is my sign"
Catching up on boring chat
Or are you transferring yours
Do you know which ISP the previous tenants had?
That's the tough part
I have anxiety and adhd :(
ugh but what if Iâm too shy to talk on the phone ðð
My guess is that you'd need to call your ISP and have them enable it
yeah
"Right, those are the only two Ethernet ports on the back?"
Itâs the Ethernet cable that came with my router
Of the router
Which plug is the yellow plugged into in the back?
"Okay, so the light next to 2.4ghz on the right should light up if it's connected to the internet"
I have this
Do you have a router
I can see the network on the drop down list of wifi networks but canât connect
The chat rn
I donât have the right dongle ð
This looks good
If it gets internet then you just have to plug it into a router for wifi
Yeah just plug that mf in
like the Ethernet cable into a laptop?
"You might not need a modem, just a router"
"Have you tried plugging that into a laptop, see if you can connect?"
What does it look like? Could be a fiber thing
Donât try to embarrass me in the chat again
Oh nvm GA is still available
Let me rephrase. It is sold out
I could be wrong tho
"I donât think so, itâs like a $35 fee to have a dude come over and drill da wall"
we can assess the property taxes!!!!! ð¥³
chet left me alone to set up the internet which feels unfair bc thatâs Boy Work
Nope but I def wanna buy today
thereâs like a weird Ethernet box but no coaxial
In the spirit of being boring does anyone know if you can set up xfinity wifi without a coaxial hole in the wall?
OMG BAGUETTE?!?!?
is it sold out?

(Sorry refusing to be boring)
Does anyone wanna see John Early this Saturday at Thalia Hall?
apple martin changed the group photo.
apple martin named the group boring chat.
With the way UaW is setting up all the contracts with the major companies to expire at the same time is setting the scene for what could become a general strike
The american labor movement is an incredibly interesting topic
"one more word, and the rotting plantain collection will pay the price"
Let me be blunt: is there a labor crisis in America today?
Probably tied for the last time we had this conversation
Gonna keep this energy going
Does anyone here have experience filling out small estate affidavitâs for the Illinois treasurer
up there for the most boring conversation this chat has ever had
so it feels like everyone's property is being undervalued
And prices were drastically lower 5 years ago
The big thing I'm noticing is that like none of the properties I'm comparing to appear to have been sold in the past 5 years
You were t kidding
"Comps should be within 500 square feet in size of each other, and within like 5 years in age of the property ideally. 

Also helps if they have the same number of units. And you can use sales of similar properties if they were within the last three years. And you can use your sales price if it helps 

And the land assessment doesnât really matter."
or senior exemptions
"Like, I'm avoiding comparing to any properties with senior freezes"
@Richie Owens should I avoid making any specific comparisons that would just absolutely torpedo my appeal?
Lower taxes pweez
They just give you a spreadsheet of comparable properties
Baby voice selfie videos
"I'm working on an appeal right now, just going through different properties nearby"
lol
Yâall its weird how property taxes are tied to my core being
My job was appealing assessments for like 6 years
Iâm sure youâre looking into it but you can contest it
I herd that multiple units increases taxes and youâre comparing to big single family homes on the boulevard
(Parents met working there)
Oh yeah well I herd
I literally wouldnât be alive if it wasnât for the Cook County Assessors Office
Itâs all recent sales of comparable sized buildings
it's driving me nuts
"I don't even think they look at anything other than recent sales records, and what the building looks like"
And for kicking up all that dust
You're probably paying more because you built that pergola
Looks like someone is going to have to cut back on Lates and Avocado toast!
"I'm looking at properties that they compare my property to, and I'm paying more in property taxes than buildings that are literally one street away from logan boulevard, and fully refurbished"
"your property taxes are tied to your property's ""assessed value"""
Yo it's actually pissing me off how arbitrary property assessments are
This would be such a good Halloween costume
Tony Hawk Tuah
Eventually all the nepo babies are going to have inbred traits like the Hapsburgs
I think everything is gonna be ok
Just found out about the Tony Hawk/Kurt Cobain grandson
As far as I can tell it's not cracked
My neighbor is throwing out this big ass TV what the hell
Simple Bread
I'm making my last batch of ice cream for geez tomorrow
Oh crap Cole's is tonight
Anyone have a simple bread recipe they like?
I'm here
Anybody else at Cole's rn?
Not even Halloween yet smh
Guy on stage is kinda just vamping right now
Man if you bring a guitar on stage you have an obligation to not be shitty
We'll see how it goes tonight
Or maybe a vintage Mitch kurka
It sounds like something Luke Neumann would write but I donât think it actually a joke of his
I feel like I wrote someone's joke thinking it's mine
Is this someone else's joke?
"I live right by Dannyâs, itâs still empty"

@Aaron Klinger wanna buy an eyelash place with me?
Probably gonna drop from the den show
I only realized today that it's the same day as AoC
hahahahahahaha
(I am booked to do the show at the Den)
IT'S SO FUN
COME TO AGENTS OF CHAOS
EXACTLY
And the water cooler
I like the paneling
I'm sold
sold
Bizbuysell
There's like 2 inches between the island and the stove
Stock can I tell you a website that you would love
lmao look at this wine bar that someone crammed into their chicago kitchen
Seen on HBO as in you have a Max account
But not as fun as the Lincoln lodge presents Agents of Chaos
Idk it seems like it could be fun!
Iâm not doing a good job of selling it
Jk jk
That's a -1 for you!!
"What if i'm already booked on this, and what you've said here has made me decide to cancel"
it is an interesting thing to do when you could do the show far easier with 32 comics and the show would not drag on for hours
"Here everyone puts âSeen on HBOâ or something else and itâs like, maybe you were on it, but no one saw it"
I live close but I donât want to see 63 comedians
I'm gonna do that and just say I misspelled hobo if they ask
in 2020 i just put âhboâ as my insta bio
actually iâm just gonna do that
i guess i can just say i performed at the den before tho
you and 63 other comedians can use The Den as a credit
(literally why I said yes to the show)
right plus you can be a scuzzball about it like that
jk it's fun but ambitious and you can hit up chelsea hood if you want in
i want to use the den as a credit
"it's like a pyramid scheme, basically"
I just dropped the show and now I'm being asked to recruit people
If anyone didn't get asked there is a one-liner show at the Den 10/16 that still needs like 50 comics
they're going lol
You should reply âyeah!! Only people should get to relieve themselves in the park! Like I do!â
You should ask how they can tell the dogs and kids apart
These two dogs are not trained at all
"I get mad when people walk their dogs off leash but in a park itâs fine if the dog is behaved? Iâve been to that park many times and itâs big, the dogs play on one side and the kids play on the other. Also Iâm 90% sure the signs donât say no dogs allowed"
We went to Palmer park and saw the dogs
Everyone is mad at this one owner who lets their dogs loose
My gf tells me about Logan Square community page off leash dog drama
"Iâm sick of people thinking their precious human child is more important than my dog (no offense @Aaron Klinger, father of one)"

Theyâll be back

Who cares megalopolis is normal
Or is somebody else Cicero
"Joey tried to use the actor participation part to ask Adam driver why, of all the Chicago streets he could pick, he chose the name Cicero instead of Pulaski"

The healthiest marriage is the one with a 17 year age gap
Itâs good I watched it w anna

G5/6

Heart reacts from your gf donât count

Gonna see the 340 imax megalopolis at regal north @Joey D Bednarski
You should give your house The Substance
Dare I say
and i hope you're all getting your fair share
are very good
the breezes the last few days
"folks,"
Or âIâm with landlord ->â
I want one
Hahahahahaha
"It says

 âmy friend is a landlord
And I hate him for thatâ"
I just thought of a really good t-shirt idea
I stand on the shoulders of giants
Where they failed I will succeed
Heâs trying to make learn from their mistakes so his house never gets old
This is the âlandlord stuffâ that youâre busy with?
Kinda dig it
Look at the hat Bob Vila decided to wear lmao
I'm watching the very first episode of This Old House right now
It's because of the minerals in the tap water
NYC is spiking his T
Heâs been more aggressive  in the chat
Shouldâve messsured @Andrew Shanklandâs testosterone before he moved to nyc and compared it to now
had a dream about finding a baby deer floating in a river and then trying to bring it on land to graze grass but all the grass was sprayed with glyphosate and there was no good grass left
You should take The Substance instead of Botox
WOW
saw the substance last night
I stood in silence while all my friends planned to see megalopolis without me and now I am being punished
But some of our plans just happen to be sitting in the best row in the entire world to see the best movie of all time
We all have plans tonight Joey
If having plans on a Saturday is snooty then call me Frasier crane
Too snooty for row L huh
If anyone wants to join for a matinee and bring me mushrooms thatâd be sick
I canât stop thinking about it
Fuck it Iâm gonna see megalopolis tomorrow
"meanwhile @Megan & I saw The Substance & I *could* describe what happens in it, but i absolutely wont."
I canât wait to hear what everyone thinks about it
Iâve never seen anything like it
All I can say about it is enjoy the ride
I fully expect it to be a 3 star movie that I think is both 5 stars and 1 star
If someone asked me to describe what happened in it - I legitimately couldnât
I am genuinely glad I watched it
Dude - you will want to talk about it
Iâm so excited to see it. Wanting to talk about it is all I want from it tbh!!!
I could talk about it for hours
I genuinely donât think Iâve ever seen or will ever see a movie like it again
Yeah thatâs truly good enough
So close enough
But I saw it on mushrooms
I did not
Did you see the ultimate imax experience
Just want to let everyone know that Iâve seen Megaopolis and Iâm different now
I have a lil table outside
I'm en route
"Foot hurts and full with a breezy window open. 

Sushi or something tomorrow would be cool"
I am very litigious
Cool I just gotta quick change then I'll meet y'all out
Letâs do it see you there
Letâs do quality time
I selfishly like quality time bc it's p close and I could walk there
oh my god the breeze is so nice rn
moving is hard rn
Whirlaway is more chill casual than QT but no booths
and bacon
i just had a lot of waffles
don't base it off me
Is that too far for u kloppy
I was gonna suggest quality time but I know it's not wicked border
IDK if ive been to whirl away but I like all of those
What about Quality Time or Dmall Bar or Whirlaway I always think
What's a sort of place that works for you/on the way from richies
I would have a singular beer on the way home from rehearsal but itâs gotta be now baby
perhaps on the wicker border
Any interest in grabbing a bev somewhere in Logan
I would go hang somewhere
Are there folks potentially interested in grabbing a lite beer Shortly in a little bit

@Adrienne Stout why are you not in the audiotree staff pics videos? Who do I talk to?
ðªº
"Yeah it would be really nice, temp jobs are cool but itâs rough that they can just let you go with no severance or notice"
Consistent place you hate>inconsistent  places you hate
Permanent would be stabilizing as heck
Just like a facilities assistant at some consulting firm. Not cool but pays better than the job Iâm at now and would be permanent
Do tell about this position
"So Iâm hoping, the other interviewers both basically said theyâd hire me (1 straight up did)"
I was basically whispering but did very well! It was third round and this round had 2 other zoom calls too
@Kristi Durkin take the tv

Just had to do a phone interview for another job at my temp jobâs desk

ROWDY

Great job @Samy Dick my son ð¥°ð¥°ð¥°
Which is WILD because they have mics that are setup to do exactly that
Laugh factory clips do not pick up the crowds laughs at all
"Like, the laughs are so different from the stage"
I genuinely feel like it's just a lack of the microphones ability to pick up laughs we'll
Iâm like woooooowwwww
Itâs such an ego killer for me
Yeah thatâs how I felt after watching the footage
But it was good!
"I'm sure I'm gonna review the footage and be like, ""man I suck"""
It was fun
How did it go?!?!
"I asked them to play throat goat for my walk-up song, but they didn't ð"
ðððð
But Papa kept BRINGING EM BACK!!!!
"Like, literally in passing"
The crowd kept pulling back every time I mentioned death
I'm gonna kms if I don't get anything from this
"Yeah, yeah, ð"
So I'd be right to kms
It's a good show! Gotta respect Jerry Hamedi for the grind on this one!
Hahahahaha what the hell
"If I didn't move, I would have killed myself if I didn't get vouch"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
It would be so funny if I got absolutely no shows from doing Vouch
So maybe that didnât help the image
I also humped the stool during my set (I was going sicko mode)
The skull one Dustin showed me was cool I wish they got it :(
But Iâm not there tonight
I can pick you one up next time if you want
no skull
I still want it
No skull?
Unless thereâs a dif new one
It says Coles in heavy metal writing
I want one if someone could get it for me I will venmo
It's the skull right?
yes
@Kristi Durkin is kpd at the Sox game I wanna build
Is coles selling new t shirts?
"I'm always saying ""give it up for your hoes"""
Then we figured out she misheard me call Kristi the host ?
A woman approached me after my set and said I shouldnât call women hoes
I think this happened bc I went down a chicago sex massage wormhole after seeing the new neighborhood spot
Are my followers all @Johnbo Walter Stockwell ?
Vouch should hang up a picture of me the way iO has pictures of Jack McBrayer
Is it true that MJ Lenderman is setting off explosives at the wedding
Let's hope he doesn't DEFLATE the water balloons for the water balloon toss!
Can you imagine the Field Day style activities she has planned?
I wish I was invited to Claireâs wedding holy shit

No DJ Friday for me I will only be donning the role of everyone's favorite character
Are you going to that wedding I donât wanna be stuck hanging with Nick Mayer
Thatâs a promise I hope you keep
"okay slow your roll Joey, Clare drunkenly asked ME to dj her wedding"
Or at least dj my friendâs wedding
Will you dj at the Friday one I have a wedding Saturday
So could be a cool idea to get tickets for that show
Just got confirmation from Richie that I will be DJing after the Matty and Richie production of Witches of Eastwick on Saturday October 19th at brick Town
Also

That's wgere I got a ton of old 80s-90s club remixes for DJing
Iâm obsesssseed with internet archive. Itâs THE PLACE to find declassified CIA documents or porn from the 60s or scans of computer magazines from the 80s.

You mentioned it was a spoiler and I think that's all I heard about it
But we also talked about it in front of you at my place a mere 2 hours ago
I think thereâs literally one immersive thing and itâs kinda a spoiler
I got L11
What's immersive about ut
Iâm there. Lmk what seats
Yep! It is epically called this
This sat?
If anybody wants to join Iâm gonna get tickets to the 7:10 screening of Megalopolis on Saturday at the Regal imax. (Itâs one of the two âimmersiveâ ones in Chicago)

speaking of chicken check out the chicken stack in my freezer rn
if you let the broth cool down outside of the fridge itâs dangerous. same with the chicken itself.

Wait are you supposed to clean your beer
I been telling myself that! Chicken is scary ð¡
I got really sick one time
You think the chicken you cooked is safe but the broth you cooked it in ISNT safe???
I know itâs a silly question but chicken is scary

I feel smart rn
Feels good to teach John a money thing
wtf
that's so funny
YOOOOO WAIT LMFAO I HAVE MONEY FROM COMED THAT THEY NEVER PAID ME BACK ON HERE
as opposed to a party u can stop by
but i feel like that would mean itâs like a full commitment
it was like 25 each for party bud for lukeâs bday
bus
i think it would be like 25 each for the bud and iâd have booze etc at dads
I like that idea bc it sounds expensive
now hold on let's not be so hasty to dismiss a party bus to Lake Geneva
Utility bill deposits they never gave you back etc
Itâs like paychecks you never got etc
If u can get folks to pay a lil bit they'll set up an open bar

we are literally still in the middle of moving stuff and it died
Anyone in Logan who wants to help jumpstart chetâs car ððð
I will say that may have been when I was there
Kristi just sent me this powerpoint and there's no way she talked about Lana del rey for more than 15 seconds
hey thatâs fair thatâs me with anime
I guess any time someone said the name I just kind of glazed over and stopped paying attention
iâm carrying the back of my generation and u donât even care
I refuse to believe this
i literally did
god please say you didn't do this at crushes w me as cohost
I will say that my coworker knows sheâs NOT Latina but thinks she has Latina vibes. I think for reasons that might be racist
"itâs almost like u didnât pay attention to my
powerpoint âtimes iâm glad i didnât know who lana del rey was until 2023â"
Or were they p good
Worse than imagine dragons?
i pulled this shit last year where were u
Also she suuucks live
Great name for a political consultant
Haven't liked her last few albums but I think Norman fucking Rockwell is incredible
Popstar sensation Liz Grant
she chose the name bc she liked Miami
nah her birth name is Liz Grant
Like Los Fee-liz
It could be that LA thing tho where maybe it has Hispanic roots but has been really americanized and is pronounced differently
I'm sorry I know everyone is having fun riffing on the leaning tower of Niles I completely understand if no one wants to engage with me finding out about Lana Del Rey in 2024
I'm sure I'm late to this but I have never thought about Lana Del Rey or listened to her music on purpose
wait it's crazy that you can choose an hispanic stage name
Specifically Nileâs
Oh he mentioned the Sears tower being a target didn't he?
just learning she's not latina
Frasier
Niles
Fuuuuuck did he actually say that?
This hair is cute tbh
My on-ozempic coworker who described Lana Del Rey as having Latina vibes asked me where the original leaning tower was located
Did you steal this bit from Conner OâMalley
hshahaahahahaahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Death toll: 5-ish
Apparently one of the planes on 9/11 was meant for the leaning tower of Niles

Is there a move this afternoon?
I make my tenants review my clips

Also why would you list your standup credits in your Airbnb bio?
Has he been doing comedy that long? Christ
Can't believe you recognized him
I do recognize this old sweaty dork
"Haha, okay I'll hit him up"
im lovin the headshot choice
yeah i dont find him creepy or anything - actually quite friendly - but if shes a comedian she may find him irritating!
Those are all the things I know about him
Rovaughn tried to fight him at a softball game
He would constantly pester Adrienne about going up earlier at Schubaâs
Every week at lotties he would need some special accomodation
Yeah I don't think he's a bad dude at all but kinda weird
She doesn't sound wildly picky as it's for 3 months
Curious if he's a decent dude but more so if she could circumvent the airbnb fees
Heâs a very annoying guy personally
My Dutch roommate needs to find a place to move and he's doing a long term air bnb
Why?
it absolutely is
I think thatâs a very old headshot of Josh DiDinato
I know him
Adam
Oh wait I think I met him at Madison comedy week
Anyone know this guy?
pretty sure I spotted the disgraced former owner of cards against humanity as I was walking out of conner oâmalley show
Would be amazed if we can go out after that but would be nice to see u crazy kids
Weâre going to Chinatown now
Just had ricobenes
Going to best intentions now
But also I could fall asleep at a momentâs notice

Never clicked an email so fast
Seems like thereâs a lot of people going to that right now
Thereâs this one on Tuesdays at Monsieur Murphyâs that I think could be good but I havenât been yet
Subconsciously
I did that last time and just did comedian jokes
Iâm trying to knock the rust off but donât wanna make the mistake of learning how to do good at bad open mics
Uncommon Ground is good
Is Coleâs and sometimes schubas the only good mics rn still?
I dont mind if you and your friends participate in queer discourse as long as you do it in the house where it's safe

This place is great. Iâve also got a couple ties for weddings there
if Danny canât find a cool suit at menâs warehouse he should go to Richardâs fabulous finds on north ave. Itâs this really cool vintage menswear shop thatâs relatively affordable where chet got a really cool suit for a wedding we went to. The guy who runs it (Richard) is like this really nice old gay guy who treats getting you the right suit like itâs a matter of life or death
iâm so horrified bc one time i wore white to a wedding
is this a dress u can wear to a wedding
Does the wedding have a dress code? Is it black tie?
xD
These days I hear even two men can get married
Thatâs very traditional
Thatâs super old etiquette I think
Itâs like are you going to a royal wedding
Grooms will literally wear whatever color these days
I haven't heard it
I don't know that there's any rule about that at all
dannyâs getting a suit rn and menâs wear house told him donât do black
or is that like girl wearing white dress
hey can dudes wear black suits to weddings
Ok done

This is how you get good
Im giving him a like and no share

"Anyway, to my HVMs Tiege Hanley's Vitamin C serum is a great way to give your face a nice alpha glow"
It also presumably puts some wear on your bike

Ethical fuckery
You can dig around the Amazon shop to make sure itâs not a small retailer through Amazon
Genius
You can buy one from Amazon then return it in time for Black Friday ð

NYC cops shot a guy for fare hopping and accidentally shot another cop like the day after Shankland got stopped. You should be grateful that youâre getting paid at all!
You would probably make more money if you quit teaching and became a cop
Gonna gripe for a second but since the nyc depart of Ed didn't fully process me as a teacher until the day before school started I have to wait until the 30th to get my first check and even then it's unclear how much back pay that will include or how they are going to go about giving me backpack ð

Literally
let him cook
Yeah Iâm projecting too much on it
Let him be weird that's one of the main selling points
Maybe Iâm overthinking it
Trying to figure out how to frame it where itâs not making him look weird in a negative way/punchy down
Weâre meeting Thursday gonna help him film a cooking show
who has told you that it's fake?
it's his voice
Moonstruck and Witches of Eastwick are for the boys (me and Joe Cariola)
he makes me feel weird
i donât understand him
iâm so confused is it a fake voice
there's been no naval warfare in any of your plays don't condescend to me

Classic pre homeowner behavior
Classic tramp stamp style Elsie
Thatâs so Elsie vibes
Came here to say I was having a weird dream where me and a bunch of friends were at a pool party fancy house we actually werenât allowed to be inside of so we all were crammed inside of a room trying to hide out from the homeowners and for some reason my boyfriendâs bandmate was giving tattoos? Elsie How was there actively getting a full tramp stamp in a crowded room of comedians and I was like dang I want one too! And she said âMaddie um you like donât get tattoos I thoughtâ and everyone started bullying me with Elsie about it. Apparently I was groaning and had to be woken up.

I wanna see Derek Begrudgingly do Master and Commander: Far Side of the World
"A mustache and script gets passed to you and you have to step in, Joey that is actually a very good idea."
actually what I want to do is make it like a game of freeze tag where anyone in the audience can take over the role of Daniel Plainview at any time
I volunteer to transpose. That is my favorite film (popular common opinion)
Maddie Daviss stars obvs
do one for the boys
@Matty Merritt @Richie Owens next play
And then we abandon the boy! Itâs Aviâs big debut and Movie screening
everyone dress as Daniel Plainview
TWBB night at the Perg
One of those movies I rewatched over and over and over again
It was my favorite movie for a while
Lots of interesting ideas about there will be blood here
can everyone
Oh every time I watch it I think itâs funnier
yeah I thought it was pretty cheerful on first watch
I love Mike!!
i just rewatched this and itâs darker than i remembered
The parody we deserve
he does kinda talk like Daniel day Lewis there will be blood
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_8u9euy1tq/?igsh=NnR0OTB5dXY4ZWNh
-3 leftist cred
He used to be Naomiâs landlord too she can vouch for Mike.
"definitely agree with the principle and if it was a company Iâd be like fuuuuuck them. Though not to lose my leftist cred and be a lib cuck, but my landlord is a nice guy and has helped me out a lot so I donât mind too much."
No free lunch
Renters got rights
Or because there's just such a power imbalance
"It just kind of annoys me that like the system is setup to aggregate small wins on the sides of landlords, and it's purely by virtue of folks just not wanting to deal with it"
Like john I like going into a home improvement project entirely too confident and figuring it out as I go along
Itâd be a bitch if I had all my stuff but I love a little project
Totally fair
"honestly Iâm not that annoyed, I move all the big stuff tomorrow and I think itâs actually going to be fun to get some beers and blast some butt rock and patch these holes in an empty apartment"
"I would, but I honestly don't wanna speak on your behalf and I don't know the whole situation"
do u wanna call my landlord and you can have a landlord to landlord chat
"Exactly, take some time to look into it so you have the ammo"
Yeah it might be annoying to look over but if you have a copy of the lease you should see what they can hold you accountable for
"No security deposit, no recourse"
Whole point of a security deposit is that they have some kind of recourse after you've moved out
You don't have to do shit
What do they have to hold you to patching the walls?
@Johnbo Walter Stockwell do something?
which like what was my move in fee for then???
theyâll charge me
What happens if you don't do it
just got my move out check list and it looks like I do need to patch my wallsâ¦. Another L for failing landlord John Stockwellâ¦
Apparently baby Kling just rizzed up livvy
Oh did you guys hear
Heâs planning something
I still have keys from shooting there I have to give back
Too bad about the space
Connor is so cool
All good if you offered
Nope but I asked Connor if I could and he said no!
When can we meet it
Also hi tomorrow my baby is a week old
Wait did you pay him back or anything for the mirror
If you patched that up before you left I think they woulda been fine
Is it because of the mirror that I broke
this has been the caroline twyman gazelleâs: an award show covering the most recent clip caroline twyman has watched
ryan oliver is the only one with star power left in chicago
this is so funny though
So the landlord W-L score is 3-845 billion
I guess we can chalk another L in the landlords column
Man that sucks
^ Don't  call me dumb
Powers*
Fuck that place was cool. The forces that be coming after our good shows
Sad news geez no longer at Connorâs studio his landlord found out and flipped a lid :(
No but good instincts
Any feedback on what to do with milk cat
When I had the opportunity
Didnât mean to do this but he was on the table so I frantically poured milk
"Love Ryan, but ALL he talks about is Grout!!!!"
He should change his stage name to Ryan Grout

Poly Caulk Allies sound off âð

I broke one of the mirrors moving out of my last place
i just removed the BS disintegrating pieces and yeah used poly caulk (ally status) (edited)
i just removed the BS pieces and yeah used poly caulk (ally status)
:(
I had to caulk the tub in my apartment like 4 times
I learned the hard way that using polyurethane caulk is so much easier than the normal shit
semi related i caulked my bathroom recently and it was a little fun
TEEHEE
JUST DOING MY JOB!!!!!!!!
valuable insight from a landlord!!
"they're supposed to use it to clean the place up after someone moves (fill holes, paint, clean)"
that's what the move-in fee is supposed to be fore
if they charged you a move-in fee
"imo, if you don't have a security deposit, there's no reason"
Unless you like filling up holes then yeah do it
If you're not getting any money back na
also anyone looking for a studio apartment lol
moving out of my place and will have a bunch of holes in the wall from hanging things up- should I fill them in? (I donât have a security deposit)

If Tom Skewerâs beautiful teenaged daughter told him about Brat Summer his head would explode
"Like, you almost have to avoided being too funny"
I think you should pitch that and maybe do something about Brat Summer being over idk honestly pitching him is just a mad lib of buzz words
See Iâm wondering if I can just do Tom Skewer
Summer is almost over
Tom Skewer
But turned down my Boeing space idea bc they did it last week
Is the eating dogs thing political
(He does this because heâs afraid of how acerbic my political writing is)

coles is awesome bc iâm exercising sooo much forward communication every minute
it was weird!!!
him and mike robinson tried to sign up twice
well idk if he was ever unbanned but he did go up last night and talk about fucking 18 year olds soooo much
"Every time I see that guy he's like ""man people don't like me"""
i guess he was banned from sarah
man we just rebanned steven curry last night
You should be like âI can actually ban you from Coleâs now too btwâ
Hahahaha
and then i said sorry dude i canât help u sounds like u dug a hole for yourself hahahaha
and then he started saying nonsense

harding tavern is literally one of the worst restaurants ive ever been to in my life
I remember liking the wings at the Harding tavern but haven't had em in a while and I think they're probably not as good/not as good a value

thank youu
thats exactly the vibe im looking for
Oh ya lotties is solid

They're not paying me to say that they've never paid me anything
Lotties!

"So I went up to these cops because I didnât want a ticket for hopping it and I said can I? And the guy got pissed and said âno you may notâ and told me to use another card and then I said I didnât have one and then told me to use a metro card and I donât have one and then we stood there for a minute and the lady said âok just go, donât do that when we arenât hereâ and I got to say âthatâs why I askedâ"
"Iâm on the subway and took the wrong train but it was only a 10 minute walk back so it was quicker than waiting but when I got there, my card wouldnât let me in because it thought I was paying for more than one persons ride (which is a weird thing to police)"
So funny that they worked out for 11 minutes and think that honored people haha

sorry is that mean
what is jackie lins vibe
Lol picturing Joey at 16 but he's still dressed and acting like a 5 year old
Joey's parents kept 9/11 secret until he was 16
He is
Your dad sounds cool
"I was 7 and donât remember much. But I do know after that day, whenever my dad had a bad day at work, heâd say âit was ground zero out thereâ until my mom made him stop"
Yeah that alibi isn't fooling anyone
I was busy that day
"Every year I must remind people that, despite being 5 years old, I have no memory of 9/11"
I'm gonna watch this when I get home
HAHAHAHAHA yooooooo
dude thatâs what I hate about people my age bc weâre like the last age group that could maybe plausibly remember it and sooooo many people milked it and are like âyeahâ¦ my mom picked me up from daycare early and I was so confused bc I normally would watch blues clues after daycare. But that day it wasnât blues clues on tvâ¦ it was 9/11 :(.
"Hahahaha you were 2 years old, you #neverremembered"
https://youtu.be/HXVmcXphykM?si=X8yR45QAG--mLxiE
"okay wait one more thing- my fave 9/11 fact is that they were filming the real world Chicago during it and during the actual attack they were taking promo photos at wrigley field, but they made them go back to the loft they all lived in and showed them the footage and filmed their reactions"
I'm lifting 36 tonnes of steel in honor of the 36 tonnes of steel that fell on New York City 23 years ago
All I found is the Regis and Kelly live taping where they find out on air about the planes
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
That's incredible
Oh god
wait before 9/11 is over can we talk abt people who do 9/11 themed workouts
@modernmammals
Did anybody here know that this movie exists and is coming out

The video call ended.
December 3rd Birthday Haver joined the video call.
Hey guys last minute meeting
catalina wine mixer joined the video call.
You joined the video call.
You started a video call.
Ok Iâll head over soon
Prolly gonna head there and just hang if anyone wants to go
Attendance so low that it still hasnât started
I was gonna quick shower and walk over there shortly
Do we have a Coleâs vibe report
Explain
An old guy with a cane and a cigar just blessed me

@Kristi Durkin are u early or late host
Taylor Swift is talking about 9/11 at the VMAs
Damn
My whole life $25?
But in the context of my whole life?
I don't doubt the value of what you get
It does seem fun
We laughed and laughed it was worth the $25
A friend and I went to a psychic over the summer and she told my friend she had osteoporosis in a past life
you didnt missmuch
hes just basically having some kid
missed the whole dave grohl drama
so much buzz the last day

I feel like my life reading is worth a little more than $25

iâm gonna start making crazy facebook post with harsh opinions
i fucking love the dare
I love the idea of the Dare also doing the laughable news
whatâs wrong with lincoln lodge?
Hahahahaha
heâs the Dare of lincoln lodge
we need to just add him in the chat
Like some looney toons anvil shit
Exactly
like stretched in a taffy machine
Heâs Long Stockwell
Different builds though
@Johnbo Walter Stockwell is Brian Roe confirmed
ok going silent in chat for another 6 months
he literally looks like worse john stockwell 2 me
yeah like this was before he opened his mouth and iâm literally valid
Got an interesting face
it was the looney toons bball jersey for me
Perfectly fine looking guy. If he had a good personality he would in fact be hot
i literally get it
no like i saw something that one night that i never saw again
Saturday at the lodge an unbelievably hot woman was fully enamored with Brian. She followed him around the whole night
in this essay i will
Ok hereâs my hot take. When people are like âcan you talk about something other than stand-upâ it gives the same vibe as people who âhate small talkâ
not so much is different between brian roe and an alt comic when u think about it
Maybe we arenât so different after all ð¤ð¤
brian roe and alt comics are obsessed with talking about stand up
the lil beekeeper's son pinned a message.
I do love that people are still just trying to rip off weekend update but with no new bit
Itâs not about how long it took him to write these jokes. Itâs about the literal years he has spent honing the craft of stand-up comedy that makes Laughable News possible
well that one guy farted in my bed and i was like wait iâm lesbo
i was also so sexually attracted to william banks
"âIf Iâm not fully horned up for Geoff, the peak of men, how will I even look at other men?â"
and now iâm doing ok and fine
and then i thought i was a lesbian for a month
one time he ran past me on the street and i was like omg hummanah hummanah
This is way funnier to me
Geoff is at least good at standup and confident
I had to say he wasnât and you wouldnât believe me
i also thought geoff asmus was hot too
"Or what if he did ""Olds News"" and did the same style segment but it was about news segments from all of history"
"yeah other people do care about comedy as much as he does, but also they .... get better...."
Yeah it is funny to say itâs a scene issue when the issue is this is lazy and so unfunny
i canât believe my first open mic i told sam i thought he was hot
I would feel bad for him but I don't actually think he's trying that hard? This can't be the product of hours of writing
Laughable news is really hard to digest
He really needs a new title
I never share Brianâs videos. I screenshot and talk about them privately
Bad news for Roe

You might as well be taking a shit on the bean
When you mock Brian roe you are basically saying you hate Chicago
John you sharing that video here is a systemic problem

Banger after banger
He posts like 8 times a day and it's all stuff like this
Posted this earlier too
I think it's unironically endorsing Harris he's been a v vocal supporter since Biden stepped down
No ideas that's why I shared I thought one of you might be able to figure it out
Wait what is he even trying to say
One time we had an hour long conversation about he was to busy and stressed to practice even though he was literally a music major lol

ok guys iâm kinda having fun w the debate rn
He said he's the new host of chill murray
heâs literally gonna open for the dare
he said heâs bringing back indie sleaze
This debate is really aimed at the type of people that live in  Woodstock Illinois
wait he just said something sooo funny
"I, for one, believe in America again"
itâs likeâ¦.. ok??
the debate is so gay
He's Mr Rife
She's Hawk Tuah
Thatâs for the next one! Matt Rife is moderating with Hawk Tuah
Who in this country is on the apps
Really limiting because they FEED off the crowd
they canât do any crowd work :/
no audience so it really just feels like brain rot rambling
damn debate already blows
one day short from 9/11
catching up and chuckling
great jokes today everyone

The old CVS across from lodge between Concord and wasabi
which building
I don't have hard confirmation but the building did sell in March and she told me that was the plan for it
I heard about it from my real estate lawyer
how do we know about trader joes
"Come hang at lodge tonight, havenât seen folks for a bit bc of my foot/ankle ð¡"
On best night ever
I will come see Joey dazzle dazzle tho
I canât get myself to wait for hours at a mic
The breakdancer?
Now this sounds like a late 2000's pg-13 teen comedy
it's actually so punk to not know about Raytheon
Joey just saved the band
You don't need to know all the names for the machine you're raging against
Tbh I think it's fine
To be fair Ray Theon sounds like they could be in a punk band
Seems like a cancellable offense in the punk world you guys canât tell anybody
Whoah thats gotta be like huge drama for a punk band
In DC and just learned my guitar player has never heard of Raytheon
Trader Joeâs in Logan Square is the final stage in the Lincoln Parkification of the neighborhood.
I just shop there for the articles
Yeah if they build a Trader Joeâs next to the Lincoln Lodge I will never have to travel more than 150 feet in life.

Tear down a parking lot to build a parking lot
They just fuckin flatten it

That's incredible
By the really cool mural we all love
Fuck me
I think it's the building across from lodge
wait I want more infoâ¦ do you know where?
the difference between someone throwing a show at the cellar that youâre on vs just being on the 10pm show
"Nobody gets ""passed"" at LF because nobody is really watching the shows the manager just books randomly same as zanies most clubs in NY have a more clear cut audition process"
I think it means more in certain scenes than others bc Chicago doesn't really have a traditionally functioning club
"Yeah, they can do official shows there and can be paid"
"I still don't understand WTF this means when people say it. Like, does this just mean that they book you? Are bookers explicitly going around telling people they're passed?"
"Reading the guy next to me on the trains texts (chill) and he called someone a âcurry cooking cuntâ and while thatâs horrible to say, itâs a pretty great alliteration"

Didnât mean to build it up
This chat is ruled by fear and fear alone
Aaron you're gonna get dogpiled if you don't spill
At the very least don't tease
Yeah what the hell aaron
that's what this chat is for
no please do
Didnât wanna start a dogpile on an annoying comic
just once i want joe eames to post me on his story saying âthe kidâ
heâs the kid for that
"The ""why"" i'm afraid was not included with this tea"
Do you think he did a blaccent the entire time they boned?
"She was like ""I bet he doesn't have any wrinkles or anything"""
She didn't see the wrinkle
He deceived her with his headband
thatâs disgusting
Because he's jacked
I think maybe because she found him attractive
thatâs so crazy
why would she have sex with that dude
Zako can't love
Yea LA comics were messaging ppl here like who is this piece of shit shes talking about
And realizing he's just a piece of ass

I'm done with chill Murray lol
Where's the hang tonight?
Sophia set her own nickname to kidult (kid/adult).
like a guy whoâs biggest political belief is that America is on the decline because women stopped wearing evening gloves is soo funny
right like I love that the factory is a glove factory and heâs so obsessed with the gloves and like how theyâre made and the craft of it but itâs just like literally who cares nobody wears gloves anymore
Also a very good representation of how the middle class things about capital
"Yeah absolutely. I think it's also funny that for the Swede it's like ""she killed 4 people"" but will immediately write off any kind of mass killing done by America. There's several parts of the book where he kind of completely writes off some sin of america and then the next paragraph starts obsessing over the doctor again"
yeah I feel like the parents stuff was great and like there were even some moments with the daughter where I feel like it was interesting that they didnât make the Swede like entirely dismissive of her cause and like tried to be a bit sympathetic of like allowing her to stay with those friends and like after sheâs gone like feeling guilty about moving the factory out of Newark (which like carries an interesting paternal thing) but then thereâs points where  heâs like maybe I shouldâve just like been way harsher and I feel like itâs a really good like representation of liberalism
"The guy can write though it was like ""Wow what if John Irving was actually good"""
This is kind of exactly how I felt.
yeah I totally get that. I havenât really read any of his other stuff but Iâve gotten the impression that heâs kind of like a grumpy old dude so I feel like heâs able to diagnose but not necessarily prescribe anything for these problems
I did like the relationship with his parents a lot I thought that was very well done
But I'm planning on reading some more of his stuff because I feel like I need to get a better understanding of him as am author to appreciate it more fully
Yeah like there'd be a lot of parts I really liked but at the end of the day it bums me out to read something that really nails the malaise of america but doesn't ultimately land on any cause
But I feel like heâs really good at writing about like the failings of masculinity and like that ties in a lot with like the idea of american decline
I feel like itâs less of a decline of the American dream thing than realizing itâs an empty thing all along. Bc thereâs so much like striving done by the Swede to like be this waspy all American guy and almost like all the stuff that falls apart feels almost like his punishment for trying to assimilate so hard. But yeah I do feel like the treatment of the daughter is a little harsh sometimes but itâs also like filtered through the narrators persona then thru how the narrator imagines the Swede to have taken things so I feel like youâd never really be able to know what Roth himself thinks.
I actually liked the daughter and it seems like he has a lot of contempt for her
"Like, the prose is good and Iiked the imagery but at the end of the day I can't really tell what he considers responsible for the decline of the American dream"
I liked it but I can't really figure how Roth feels about America lol
oooh whatâd you think?
I finished American Pastoral and would like to discuss
Chicago style was excellent

Does anyone know of any improv jams in Chicagoâ¦â¦
Possibly. No way to know because it was in Spanish and a capella doesnât translate well to English
Aka Chicago
They were singing the Bible Acapella?
The church next door to me is throwing their block party and right now theyâre reading the Bible in Spanish and having somebody translate it in English. Earlier some kid was singing a capella

Open enrollment in Wet T-Shirt/9/11 Crushes this weekend. Like this message if you want to perform and get soaked in a way that honors our first responders
I mean it's so gd funny he lectures about eating pussy now
"Matt brown randomly told me he was âabove me in the sceneâ and I said âthatâs honestly kind of a douchey way to talkâ

Then he told me my reaction was because I am homophobic and racist"
I wish in this moment you kept that personal invasion
Felt like a personal invasion
But I deleted it

sorry late to game
wait is he just identifying as a lesbian now
hmm he was always nice to me ð
Waiting for the YouTube episode to drop for my cousin
Heâs been incredibly rude to me as well. Also annoying
But he has also always been a dick to me so maybe I am projecting a bit!
I mean I think ex-gay is a bit but heâs just kinda always straddled the like
Is he like âIâm dating a woman because Iâm biâ or like Iâm straight now
Jk
Whatâs that supposed to mean
"To be clear, he still acts extremely gay"
Thank you for understanding the gravity of the situation
Thatâs so funny to hard pivot away from being gay
I think they were making babies and I saw one of the babies and it looked at me
He was making kisses with her in the green room
Hmmm actually idk if I would
"Like, if I was gay, I would do this"
It has all the signs of an elaborate bit
Hahahaha this is really so funny
Youâre trying to make my head explode like a guy in a cartoon
Iâve convinced myself you all are doing an elaborate bit
My mind cannot accept this
I donât think you guys are understanding how jarring it was to hear Matt brown talk at length about eating pussy
I've decided I'm only going to like the things that I really TRULY like in this chat
Gay is more like a state of mind really
Thatâs kind of a pronoun
Wasnât he going by miss brown for a while
Wasnât worried about it until he became ex-gay
Oh he just says shit like âI donât do pronouns; i have a jobâ
What was this again
???
Just heard Lindsey porter tell a bat joke
Between that and the pronouns shit I truly think he is going down a dark path
Matt Brown came in looking like he was doing drag as a straight man and then talked for four minutes about how heâs dating a woman
Also do people know that Matt brown is in a straight relationship
Fucking sellout
How are the fresh faces??
Sorry Iâm in the laugh factory thatâs what I think is funny when Iâm here
Damn heâs really starting young
The only thing we knew at the time was that he was getting divorced
Is this why you fart on your uncle
Who had with a woman that was not his wife
Last family reunion he showed up with an infant
This is really actually my cousin
Oooof
If you see my cousin
Changing my DOB

What if I want to burn an American flag?
Something tells me I think you'll be ok
I found out I have to tell my boss if I get arrested. Isn't that a load of bullshit?

Mr. President a second Zako Comedy Bar Beef post has struck the feed
Ya people are here

So are people at Jeff's?

He is seemingly just a dumbass with bad taste and a lack of moral judgement. Idk if he's done anything bad
lmao
Zako goes Austin style on dogs yeah #teamzako
I like him heâs never been annoying to me tbh
St James is fine
I just read that this morning and I was tired and wanted to check
is there a comedian in the scene who kicks dogs?
St James is welcome at bball far as Iâm concerned. Hacks welcome
I think st James touched a cum rag? Idk was focused on the game
Why not just do Popeyes and dj
Weddings are kinda stupid
What is St James deal also? Why is he bad Iâm sorry Iâm out of the loop ANd I donât ball
Wait is there something else that happened besides them showing up out of spite?? Did they talk to you or ignore and only play with the game on the other court
isnât that awesome

and in the middle of awards season no less
ok wait sorry just caught up and read it all- this is so crazy that humboldt 10 am has turned into a war
i need more info on bball
I believe the official start time is âafter Jonahâsâ
itâs getting kinda late
i guess you can still ask for his location to keep an eye on when he gets home and itâs ok to move in
3435 w medill - i was gonna guess that!!!!
i was gonna suggest ask if he can share his location with you so you donât have to ask specifics
ask if itâs brunch potluck vibes or evening apps vibes
i love a mystery
love him
lmao
"he messaged me that it was at ""his place"" today but no address or time lol"
house party or at a bar?
Definitely did it on purpose lol
or just clueless
wait did saint james do it on purpose
I donât think heâll be back again
Like you're not doing anything but showing how dumb you are
Which is what's so funny
That's it
Hahahaha yeah
Ya what was the details? They just played at the other courts?
like okâ¦. calm down
yeah i had a feeling when he was like im coming
hahahah oh
what happened w st james
The sadam effect
Andrew and Dunne leaving created a basketball power void akin to the Iraq/afghanistan war causing  Isis
I will be reading American Pastoral but the other recs will be added to the list ty all
Big brain didnât realize
Like this message if I should get enough wings for you
Anyway Iâm grilling wings at my place at 7 and maybe folks can go to Jeffâs afterwards
You handled it well tbh
No you didnât cause a mess! He should have been kicked out the day he was put in
Genuinely
No thank you so much
Sorry for causing a mess
I kinda doubt he shows up next week. But ya maybe weâll move to the north courts
But this is a war against people who are mentally unwell in an un-fun way. Thereâs no knowing how far theyâll go
Gonna pass out adderalls if he comes again and weâll just lock it in to focus on our side
I just meant a new location in Humboldt. Always Humboldt
St James and Noshod live like 30 to 45 minutes away
One more at most
"No itâs Humboldt 10 am, a new location canât happen. Itâs a war of attrition. We will win."
"I donât think itâll stick, his spite will tucker out"
Nah I really doubt they'll keep coming the location is so inconvenient for them
You handled it well
Maybe we do new chat new location lmao
Those guys already hate me anyways
Make me an admin Iâll go scorched earth
Canât invite LF comics anywhere smdh
"If St James keeps coming, I'm gonna invite him to play with us every single time"
"Like, if you're gonna try this, I'm gonna ignore it and make you feel stupid"
Buddy making ppl uncomfortable is the whole issue how can you not get this
Which is kinda why I invited St James to play with us while he's here.
We had a awkward little exchange but then he walked to play with the other group
Yeah I had a feeling he would show up out of spite
Yeah he is a child
I think the idea is to make folks uncomfortable
Basketball has been compromised
Haha noshod is there? This is ridiculous
That's such a St James move
Ok so St James definitely invited that group to ball on the court with Noshod lmao
That he is not marketing well
Yes but also I think Jeff Brumfield is having a party tonight
Would folks wanna come over to my place if I grilled tonight
Going to studio with a couple white rappers from st paul later so I will be well rounded on art today
I picked up American pastoral a couple weeks ago from that used bookstore near lodge so this is good to here
Theyâre playing one more game I think
Itâs winding down
Do you think people will still be balling in 30?
What are the sides for the war
My props got spikes
I've used timer lights where the on/off states were confusing
What do they look like
bc i leave the house at like 8 am and itâs 5 pm
which proves that i didnât turn them on
and thereâs an option for a timer switch (last six hours) and itâs always on that
Ok tbh it sounds like you havenât figured out how the candles work
and i canât really put my finger on what it could be
and itâs happened like 5 times
i have three electric battery operated candles that i donât turn on before i leave for work and then i come home theyâre all on
Itâs just called having haters
but iâm absolutely being haunted
but i donât even believe in ghosts
ok but iâm clocking in so iâll tell u in five hours
least book i read was the flick by annie baker
Like i wanted to be an English teacher when all I knew was school
Go on ð»
i think iâm being haunted
That seemed like where I was going but then I realized you didnât have to do school
Very like âstimulating discussionâ vibes in a good way
You would be a great English teacher actually
I would teach Plot Against America in a high school English class
It was my first of his but I could see myself becoming a roth-head
Plot against America is a good book
I like Phil roth
Itâs abt a girl bombing a post office in the sixties which feels shankland-core
last book I read and liked was american pastoral by phillip roth
What if he asks you questions that could lead to some hilarious answers
Why
Hahahaha maaaan I don't wanna play basketball with St James
The Bee Sting by Paul Murray is my fav from this year
Demon copperhead and the secret history have been my fav books Iâve ready this year

Twisters 4DX front row fucked my neck up lol

Ah yeah they're pretty kitchen core
but i am greatly appreciative
these might be too kitchen coded for my bathroom
Kinda faucet bragging
Why did you show both faucets
also called me transphobic for doing a show at the annoyance which is so funny
but she didnât book sagr houston and the argument made no sense
gwen went after cassidy for not booking her on promedy and booking sage houston over her
Higher quality but less functional
like nightmare blunt rotation
itâs like me gwen rose vik pandya
This the other one
ok be real is glitterus actually a good show or should i just drop
"If only detectives werenât cops, could be pretty fun lol"
so crazy
"Full circle cum rag confirmation, itâs Mattyâs"
It's not like the best retracting faucet but it works
I have one in a box that looks like this
"I have a new one, and one thats used, but I'm definitely never gonna use"
send epics
"Cross examining now, every novelty cum rag has its own fiber pattern like a strip of duct tape"
@Matty Merritt analyze
Literally me!!!!
Bruce screenshot the cum rag message and letâs see if itâs Mattyâs
Hahahahahahaha
Oh yeah I actually literally do
Also for everyone's awareness MVP @Aaron Klopfer went over and checked on them that day
Got off work at whiskey restaurant just to clock in at cat sitting conspiracy shop. Could be Iâm connecting the dots too fast.
Whaat I didn't know it was her rag
Unless multiple people have cum rag novelty towels
"ATTN: the picture of the Cum Rag towel came from Mattyâs house where she was ALSO ignoring the cats at the same time. You guys have a lot to talk about. Fuck a basketball chat play, I want to watch the Gwen Rose cat sitting true crime doc"
Thank you Jonah!! I have literally not been coming to basketball out of fear that he would show up
And I don't baffle easily
I was baffled
"But not a funny enough joke excuse?? If itâs a bitâ¦. Like whoops I dropped the ball and almost let your cats die, but at least let me make you laugh ? No logic no sense just casual animal neglect and subtle bridge burning"
No itâs insane truly
Well she didn't check on the cats!
"And like if she had said ""I can't watch your cats because I'm having an anxious episode"" I would not have pressed for details"
Was that supposed to be a bit? Or a legitimate excuse. What is happening I feel insane
âListen you might not like that Iâm neglecting your cat but youâre gonna love this terrible bitâ
Very obviously a gag gift or a prop for a show that someone just kept using as a regular towel
I donât get it
"And then sent me a pic of a towel that says ""cum rag"""
She said she couldn't leave the house bc she got tricked into touching a towel
sorry iâm like woah shocked
she did that to matty
Wait Bruce yes I think maybe you mentioned it??? And then when I heard the Matty story I was having Deja vu
did she come in once and then never come back/ check in on them
Thatâs crazy. Canât believe you never told us that
Yeah I might have told this already but it was completely ridiculous
she almost killed mattys fucking cat
she did that to matty
WAIT BRUCE REALLY
She abandoned my cats at Christmas do what u gotta do
People that I feel bad for but also make me feel bad
"I agree that's a tough feeling. Like, there are plenty of people that make me feel like that in Chicago"
but i donât want to drop a show bc of that
and iâm sure being her is hard i feel bad for her tbh but i just like donât enjoy the energy at all
sheâs been so mean and cruel! i really donât like being around her
not the please like this
noooooo
Haha this made me remember that two days ago Gwen sent me a reel of hers asking me to like it
sheâs like gone after my entire friend group and actively bullied them and iâm like nooooo i donât want to be in a room w u girl
while weâre on this vibe
i donât want to do a show with gwen rose tn
Ahahaha
jonah iâm submitting u to the gazelle shout outs for this one
Oh sorry to be fair I am just calling him autistic
Unless one of you acts up
Probably my only act as Admin
thatâs so funny i didnât realize he was autistic i thought he was just a huge improv fan
Jonah you're cool as hell for banning noshod immediately
Yeah Giuseppe has some hilarious moments
Heâs a sweet guy
Fuck him for making fun of Guiseppe
People talk Joey
oh my god
It was so mean spirited. Told him to talk so he could keep making fun of his voice
hey man we kicked u out we hate that u sat on the stool
Itâs literally called stand up
ahahaahahahahaahahahahah
The biggest crime of all
And he sat on the stool
thatâs so annoying
Idk why Shankland would have heard of this
oh noooo he was mean to him
When for once I wasnât
Yeah. And to say âoh we were all making fun of you in the cornerâ
Giuseppe
That nice autistic boy
Oh yeah
No the being mean to the guy
Ahahaha what did he do at schubas
Are you just talking about his boring ass set or did something else happen?
With choreographed passes and drama
i want to hear what happened at schubas god dammit
I meant OF basketball. Like I want to see Comedy Basketball play out like a basketball team drama
I'm waiting for someone that actually knows what happened to explain since I don't want to talk out my ass
I'm driving and need something to pay attention to
Context pls
speak on that
his set is transphobic!
I want to see a live stage play or Basketball
"Make every woman I know uncomfortable? I say nothing

Make me uncomfortable? NOW we got a problem"
I heard about the schubas thing out here so you know it's fucked up
Do tell.
what did he do
Plus he did some stuff that pissed me off at Schubas last night
Yeah. When he wasnât speaking in the chat it was whatever. But once he starts thinking about showing up then itâs no good
Always knew Jonah had it in him to protect the community
"I, for one, will not be impressed until Jonah calls Noshod out in public"
Damn what an eventful day
Yeah Jonah speak for the community
maybe he should hear more of that
idk i think u could not reply but also nothing wrong w telling him he makes people uncomfy!
jonah ur soooo real for that
busy*
bush day at work was thinking of the chat the entire time
wait i really need to catch up
I need to know what kind of sick shit and power moves go on in the basketball chat
bat symbolism
Jonah: (face entirely covered by a cloak) I can do what youâre afraid to do
at first i thought stockwell hacked jonahâs account
Wait Jonah amazing
good stuff everyone
Just getting caught up. Bat thing amazing and Jonah removing noshod seconds after admin approval is hilarious
God this chat is so funny lately
I was literally telling someone yesterday I was bummed he was in the basketball chat so thank you ð jonah
and what with the holiday im thinking of washing my hands asap
@Johnbo Walter Stockwell do you have any extra faucets lying around i just found out i need to replace mine

idk i think this could send shockwaves thru the community
luis invited a few ppl ð¤·ââï¸
i feel like the etiquette is not to invite people to something if youâve never been
"No right or wrong way, Iâm sorry if this is adding any stress"
So true
In my opinion
Donât answer you donât owe anything
Idk what to do
Excited for the Jonah Noshod beef this fall
â¤ï¸
Ty @Caroline Twyman @Jonah Eggleston
the picture of a glass of water makes this even funnier
hahahahahahahaha
"Just got off the plane to get rid of the bat (long flight, came from Cape Town), really wish I got the Wi-Fi so I knew John took care of it"
the way im demolishing the accept button
It was very harrowing
These free sound effect descriptions go hard
is anyone here over 25 years old? i think im not eligible
[collective sigh of relief]
alright i'm all caught up on the bat story
"aaron ""59 likes"" klopfer pinned a message."
ð¦
They wear out quicker than you think they will
He can campaign there all he wants; he will never win the electoral college in basketball chat
Speak on that
I like docs tho
I have a whole annoying thing about docs
Iâm thinking about juicing up my height for the fall
Do we have any feelings about redwing boots or doc martins?
He might flip battleground chats now
Johnâs poll numbers took a big jump since bat
ð¦
ð¦
ð¦
ð¦
Gonna throw toy cows in the air
that's dangerous
you're the closest to the twister!!!!
Front row twister 4DX tickets tonight
Huge day
$17 perfection
They remastered them
I canât say enough good things about Costcoâs Kirkland jeans
I'd be game to go
Building a pergola has made me realize what really matters in this world ð
Really appreciate you saying this
how did the bat get in?
the video is nice
How did I miss the bat chat
Anyone going to Fantasy Quest ?
Kerry Anthony named the group bat chat.
thatâs so true!
Something changed in him once he built that pergola
John has really gone from zero to hero these last 6 months
but saying goodbye to the bat that put up no fight was very sweet
i knew how the video ended but i was still nervous the bat was gonna escape & torment john at some point
It was one of them mytosis looking mfs
I'm already on the hunt for this fucker
The police can finally lock this fucker up with your help
Anyway ID the bar please
Mostly he just honks at Wendyâs employees
Sometimes John decides to stunt on us all by reminding us of his generosity and willingness to drop everything and help his friends out of a jam
And then I had a CRAZY idea ð¡ð¤ª
I shared a nice video of Tootie first
sucks 2 suck
the escalation from honey almond butter hot dog to bat bag was so swift
Welcome!
But in all seriousness thanks again John. Me Kari and my boys really appreciate it
Hahahahahaha
"The video was heartwarming, this feels like a misstep"
OMG there's a bat in my house now
That's how I've always talked? ð¤
John's Mickey Mouse voice at the end was also an interesting creative decision I wonder if that was ad libbed
So I had to sorta do a very scared reconnaissance to find where the bat was
So I was sorta stuck in my bedroom not knowing where the bat was or how to deal with it
Ya they were chasing it
But then I peaked open the door and the bat was flying around the hallway and idk if folks know our layout but the Halfway is right outside our bedroom and there isn't really a good way to get to any windows or doors without it
Had the cats noticed the bat?
No sponsored ads. Yeah that is the real mystery how did it get in and what are the odds
I quickly ran and got my cats and snuck them into our bedroom
CHICAGOS BEST LANDLORD
"It was just freaky bc we got back from dinner, don't know how it got in, and was flying around our apartment"
It takes a village. John is trying to win Best Landlord in the Chicago Reader and putting up a pretty decent campaign
This was a very wholesome way to end my night nice work everyone
He is my landlord now
John really helped me and my family feel safe in our time of need
Also Ian was wearing a bullet proof vest for some reason
The bat may have been Kari
I did NOT see Kari
I wanna be clear
"But fortunately, for it's sake, it didn't struggle"
I was ready to use centrifical force to keep it in the bag
It was like this
How did you get it out??
That wasn't a normal bat
It was like a full grown parrot
"That was, no joke, the biggest bat I've ever seen"
Just got word that the bat painted a fake tunnel on the wall and Ian ran right into it
This is beautiful and awful and I am following along like I assume they did on the OJ car chase
I'm buzzing you up
Hohn your the best
Landlord is here
We already did that
I would try and get the cats in your room then open the back door and try to chase it out
Johnimal Control is coming
Animal control can't send someone over till morning
This isn't a normal bat!
Ok I just got inside and now we're all trapped in the room
they prob have done this before
have u called animal control?
Ok I'll come by lol with some brooms and stuff
But part of this is problem is we are trapped in our room and there's like no brooms or anything super helpful to deal with it
This is why bats donât support front line workers
I really would love a hand I don't really know what to do
"I'm coming over Ian, I'm bringing stakes, garlic, and stuff to maybe catch a bat"
I want to see a pic or video of this bat
this is actually Ian and Kari slyly revealing theyâre vampiresâ¦.
BAT ICE CREAM????
ALTHOUGH WHAT IF MORE BATS FLY IN????
I used to get bats in my cabin when I worked at summer camp and the most effective thing I found was to open all the doors and windows and bang pots and pans together
Easier to clear out bugs than bats
"Also, alternatively, just turn off the lights and open a bunch of windows and let it fly out"
Iâve been looking into buying a strobe light for a video thing and a lot of the reviews say they used it for scaring away bats so maybe you can do that?
We can capture it and set it outside
"Ok, do you want me to come over with some tools"
Hahahahahahahahaha Ian
"We are sorta walled off in our bedroom, we're not sure how it got in here and it's flying around our hallway and I don't know how to deal with it"
"Also, update, almond butter and honey sandwich on hotdog bun was good"
Do you have a fireplace?
Hahahaha what!!!
A bat somehow got into our apartment
What do we think?
Will it be good?
I just made a honey and almond butter sandwich on a hotdog bun
Momo can meet and they can play!!!!
Bring it to basketball
which to be fair it is
i think he thinks autism is a funny word
What does this mean
getting her a service harness and taking her everywhere this weekend
my neighbor just knocked on my door and asked me to watch her fish over the weekend and iâve never felt more important
It seems really fun!
They have puppets serve ice cream
It's at color club!
Iâm gonna trick you into being a puppeteer one of these days
they wanted to lock me up and throw a sock on my hand
oh god the place color club kept emailing me about working at
i believe its at Color Club
I got your sugar hole right here
What cross streets
Whatâs the sugar hole
@Aaron Klopfer is that the ice cream you got the other day?
Wait have you guys been going to the sugar hole?
yeah because they should pay you for the emotional labor of having to deliberate on whether u should tell them
genuinely iâm like do i have to tell my boss i just soaked a chair HAHAHAH
literally got up from my desk today and my chair was COVERED in blood and i just walked out LOL
He'd probably be taking money away from the homeless man

Cat wife swap?
"I'm actually going out of town 9/14-17, could you do 9/14+15 and I'll do two days for yours?"
Like this if you're available to check on my cats a few times between 9/16-25. I am assembling a team
she is  a perso NOT A COFFEE TABLE >:(
ghostwriting has its own joys
this was good exposure therapy to letting go and feeling secure
@Aaron Klopfer sorry for not tagging you in my story didnât expect for it to pop off historically
Nice job bro ð
Aaron def slammed ðâð
I left my phone at self checkout and just found it
Found this shirt at a thrift store in Arizona
Nvm impulse passed
Theyâre not expensive and I think it would be cool
You canât share your memes over a walkie talkie
They can go pretty far
Anyone wanna get like walkie talkies
Anyone else love to hate Bert kreisher and Tom segura

"They typically do bachelor parties before wedding as sort of like a ""one last hooray"" before their lifestyle dramatically changes"
no â¤ï¸
My brotherâs bachelor party is there this weekend and I have not been given any good reason why
Stfu these are all so hot!!!!!

did you hear my new about cavities tho
today is slightly worse vibes than yesterday â¨ hope this helps

Idk but theyâre all dope
I like 1 da most but I feel like non comics would like 3 a lot
I used to be self conscious about overalls but I think it can work
sooooo cute
wear em w a wife beater
overalls are perf outfit
I think n itâll be cute for the fall
sarah larson showed me a pic and i started crying i was like âiâm soOOOO UGLYâ
Bought some overalls finally
i literally had a freakout during this photoshoot
All bangers
not fuck with that
some nice nature stuff around there but it's august so I wouldn
phoenix sucks
been to Phoenix several times since my mom moved there a few years ago so I have kind of an interesting answer to this question: no!
It'd make sense to surface content to an initial percentage of following and only increase that surfacing based on engagement imo
Is it based on a mix of engagement and following now?
my girl group chat said that one too
ok letâs ride
"Yeah, I think 1 shows Coleâs more than the other two and the other two are great pics that can be used for anything"
the sitting at the bar one?
Then Iâm gonna say 1
i just think i wanna save the other pics for other promos
Can we do a carousel
itâs for me âi host coles nowâ post
Theyâre all great
bathroom is mt fav but i think maybe i should just do the pic at the bar
What is this for?
Leaning 2 but they're all good
which one!
how do
thank u dude
Apparently instagram changed theirs and now everyoneâs reach is fucked
Everyoneâs algorithms are so confusing
"Reddit has a system for differentiating genuine engagement, so your up votes might not immediately count"
I upvoted wth
I fucking dare you bitch they love me on there
We can work it out in the producers chat
could enroll here? https://www.phoenix.edu/
I'm going to Phoenix this weekend is there anything cool to do there
Ok epic
Show usually starts like 15 minutes within that time
8
Bring a court date
When da doors tho
8
Iâm genuinely sorry you have to deal with him
Gonna bring a date ð
What time does agents start typically?
heâs soooo insane to me hahahaa
We should do this
I do like this idea a lot
Is he gonna mention he needs to get a reserved spot at Coleâs bc of this
@Kristi we have to cancel
FUCK
Ah shoot weâre all busy on Sunday
Im starting a half hour open mic. 48 person list
I'm kind of over this short set crap
I would only go to that if there were at least two comics who were running half hours
heard there's a pretty cool show at AliveOne on Sunday
Love this
Bc then I think we could generate buzz for the show and drama and then start selling a narrative of John's revenge comeback show
It's my producer goal to slowly accumulate power and gain enough of John's trust that I'm able to kick him off the show
I was just about to say
You should oust John. I think thatâd be a fun punishment
I'm a producer on the show now
Agents of Chaos tonight btw if anyone wants to come hang and watch us abuse each other
climb anything/playing with string couplet knocked me out
Letâs goooooooo that is the best

Fast bike teeth
Working the whole weekend and Monday :)
is there anything fun happening this weekend for labor day
Level 50 tooth grindset
as someone who just left part 2 of my root canal i could not be more jealous and happy for you
They also said that I have ground my front teeth down to levels that you usually donât see until someoneâs late 50s
They found no cavities and expressed admiration that I had never had a cavity in the past
I didnât get a cleaning for years so I didnât want to include myself but it has just been confirmed
Adding you to the No Cavity chat
Still never had a cavity bitch
Least attractive to whom? Definitely not my wife
Magic trick
They did a John segment
I want to!
I'm also gonna post something today just to spite you
Is anyone going to Saturday riot fest?

"You either do good, or some moron that has no clue is like, ""stopped watching 5 seconds in, spend more time doing comedy before posting here"""

Also Iâm moving back to the US next week and Iâll be in Chicago sept 14-24 if anyone wants to hang then :))
You guys should move to a new country and change your number
Hahahahaha I subscribed to them too for the same exact reason
Donât get me started on my 20+ daily MAGA texts

Not if I see you first
Not sure if the shudder speed could keep up!

Just saw Joey riding his bike
Maybe that's a factor?
"Also, me and Rebecca finished all of the ice cream you brought to the party yesterday"
Smh
I feel like my long hair is just like tickling the pores around my ears and clogging them. It's driving me insane.

Just listened to a 42 minute speech about sitting my white ass down and listening
I'm listening...
just listened to a 41 minute long speech about the power of silence
Oh wait itâs 9 lol
I just mean that they close at 8 pm
You walk in you're like yup
Just a fresh market place
Like no potential association with negative vibes

Fresh market place was such a better name

Could do without their owner always yapping about it tho
They don't mind it
Ive talked to them
I think they're ok with it
I haven't drank out of it so I can tell you about quality but my cats appear to be drinking water of mine
Yeah they both need filters they both need to be cleaned
They both seem to need to be cleaned the same amount in my experience

Neon Beecroft: Landlordgelion
I think I've made this riff before but it bears repeating
Me and Eva ended up paying our broken lease landlord Neon Beecroft an extra month of rent like buying him off with a post lease security deposit somehow? Very weird
Especially if youâre not looking for a roommate and offering a whole apartment.
i imagine subletting isnât as hard w fb groups now a days
yeah it feels relatively easy??
My experience has always been that they'll like ask you to find a replacement
"Usually if you just talk to em you can break it, like if you can't pay the rent for some reason they're always going to prioritize finding someone that can over fucking you over"
has anyone ever broken a lease before
Double dare me
Or contestant I donât really know
