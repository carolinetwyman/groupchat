"Oh thanks for handling that, Caroline!"
i literally might know how but it's gonna take a day
I thought it was going to be longer tbh
I love how everyone is releasing their pictures with the Sidekicks minion from Bruce/aaron's karaoke party on a different day. Really is making the minion feel alive.
Thatâs science baby. I think we have turned it around because the act of sending a first draft unfinished emotionally charged is a universally terrifying experience and I am willing to admit all the errors in my waysâ¦. Interesting how management never ever has to admit when they are wrong. If only there was a better way..
summer 2025 is gonna hit different

sorry maddie
only one maddie/matty is allowed to have a good day and i used up all the good on my bday :(
/ sorry that happened to you Maddie:(
happy birthday Matty!
Happy birthday matty!!
All good to know info. It is not going well lol
Happy birthday Mattison!
hahahhahahahah why is there not an undo send optionâ¦ i feel like outlook has or had this
Just for the future
I wish they had that setting in the chess app
Happy birthday Matty!!!
You can change settings to like have an email sit in your outbox for however long before sending
I EXPECT MY EMAIL TO REACH THEIR INBOX THE MICROSECOND I HIT SEND
"They're literally waiting 30s to send it, just in case you decide to back out"
It's so funny how that works
*unsend
Some have a resend option if it was within 30secs or a min
What emailer do u use?
"I committed the cardinal sin of accidentally hitting send instead of draft on a very emotionally-charged, unedited email about scheduling issues to my new general manager. New layer of hell I canât handle"
thank you I am blessed to be in a group of so many capricorns and spoiled by all ur love
Happy birthday Matty!!
Happy beautiful birthday to our dearest Matty
incredible job opportunity for @Joey D Bednarski

Ohh
What is gay ass
"Chicago coyotes are like cicadas, they come and go in a 17 year long cycle"
you must be in cahoots with the Quiznos Coyote
There never was no coyote and there certainly never was no coyote incident!
No Never
Did anyone else hear about the coyote Quiznos incident
I canât believe I never knew there was a coyote in a Quiznos in 2007
Hahahaha
Huhâ¦needed the captions
It was bizarre
He did great!
Diego was handed the best possible audience he could have ever asked for
"gay ass is also packed audience core, such a good crowd"
that show looks so fun! is sully running that
Got exhausting to watch after a while
Like just justifying every shooting
And he was basically just a shooting apologist lol
I used to watch this dude on YouTube that was a former cop and he would do shooting breakdowns
Copcast!
Itâs very Chicago
"It was me, a musician, am artist who does the posters for the O Sees and a former cop who started a podcast"
That show looks really cool
Actually pulling an audience!
Dude is doing a talk show at a bar in Lincoln square
Huh?
This Welcome to the Show thing is so cool
"His profile says ""Drag Queen"" so it's ok"
Itâs because heâ does musical comedy
And itâs not because every single one of his jokes is homophobic
But I do not like him
Iâve still never seen him
So no one has to follow him
Lmao they put Diego last in the lineup
Or rat race
What about spy kids
I wanna do this one but they wonât let me
it depends on the day

say you also volunteer at uncommon james
How do you guys binge drink so much
No I wish I worked at fabletics
Thatâs good info @horby This is why you should be a bumble consultant

i feel like you should make the sentence completely all caps or add in something a little more ð¤ª like ârecently did a photo shoot with a minionâ
do you actually work at fabletics

There have been some pretty bad ones telling me Iâll get whatâs coming to me and sexual stuff etc
Theyâre both like âthis is whatâs wrong with liberal menâ and âactually beekeeping is for conservativesâ

Just wanna say when they mentioned the Denver Nuggets on chapo the other day that was huge for me
https://www.lincolnlodge.com/ wtf
-a bit
of course
Power of nightmares
Forget the name but super insightful
Also the one where he highlights the similarities between the rise of the Taliban and the neocons is excellent
Ya hyper normalization is crazy good
Also she's been on chapo lol
It was so cool when Sarah canvassed for bernie with Eric Andre ngl
and we talked about hyper normalisation w her lol
one time my ex boy chat put sarah squirm in the chat when you could still do that on twitter
Only Curtis I don't care for is the one who never books me at laugh factory!
Only Curtis I didnât care for so much was the Soviet footage with no narration. Hey Adam ur supposed to tell me how to feel
Anyone trying to brutalist
Is there a move tn
Did you see he made a weyes blood music video lol
"I put it on to get woke, but whatever"
Like heâs such a good editor
trauma zone was sooo good. not to be gay or whatever but as an editor it is really inspiring
Just watched the one about the mall in England
I'm like 35 min into hyper realization but I put it on to fall asleep a lot
I was watching traumazone to fall asleep
okay but if weâre talking mark fisher the realll question is who are the adam curtis heads in the chat ð¤ð¤
Yeah the beauty of capitalist realism is its so short
i like to pair my mark fisher with maggie nelson
thatâs def something to pick up when ur unemployed lol
I wanna read the big anthology of everything that was on k punk but itâs like 1000 pages lol
It's so good
Ive got a library trip coming up and im gonna get this hot book yall are talking about
I just know he propped up verso books for a year with that purchase
"when I worked at cards against humanity the guy who ran it (who ended up getting canceled) ordered hundreds of copies of capitalist realism to give everyone for christmas but he forgot, so there were just like mountains of capitalist realism stacked by the front door for anyone to take lol"
"heâs super good at articulating things in a clear way!! possibly the best, reading his post punk book rn"
thatâs fucking weird behavior iâm sorry
she wonât book claire sundbye on lesbian lodge
like yes
Adult show and tell?
they have this thing against me and theyâve had it since college and wonât book me for mainstage and itâs lowkey bullllllshit
cancelling all these shows and booking ur friends who arenât comedians to do powerpoint nights is not the community forward thinking u think it is
It'd be like a full show not just the record
Million percent
I listened to a podcast on Hauntology and Lost Futures but after reading this I think the book has got to be better. He's explains zizeck so well it's very impressive
Wait I hope you were serious lol
Just group messaged yall on insta! I think they have a form to fill out I have just messaged them in the past
borkey is morally corrupt
wait i have a lot to say about lodge bookings but at work
iâm huge mark fisher girl
yes
Despite being literal gaming history
Oh Because Christian Borkey emailed Guinness and said the PokÃ©mon reading didnât sell enough tickets
That guy was not legit sorry to break bad news
Not officially recognized at sloppies
Yeah it's a lung capacity challenge more than anything else
"Wait Iâm confused, did you not already accomplish this goal at World Record sloppy Sunday"
So im guessing its not PokeRap style cause you gotta go so fast
Yes! Can you connect me
Bruceee you should totally do that at bricktown that would be electric
Oh yeah how could I ever forget
Wait Bruce how were you going to win the Lodge a Guinness world record?
Yeah not worth it
We'd probably have to know a land lord tho to have access to that sort of thing
If only there were some sort of... magical garage event space with some sort of multi functional heating AND cooling unit that could be sort of the new underground diy alt comedy space
Man that sucks Jeff
We can't have you burn down the theater with 3 presale and no Guinness book of world records
Watch them schedule AOC and Chicago method technique at the same time
Sorry @Jeff Braun  I am sorry I know this is old news now but this makes me so mad at Christian Borkey and Lincoln Lodge generic idiocy and overall desire for standup hegemony. Is there another generic standup show that she knows will make them tons of money waiting in the wings? Hilarious to watch the series of emails evolve over the years
I'm literally like I will rent a theater I will buy all the tickets myself
call it the chill as fuck show
Lodge has ignored all my emails about a show that would immortalize them in the Guinness book of world records
What if it was a hit though
You should show them how little you care. Call your show âFuck You Comedy Showâ or something dumb like that
he speed reads 5 newspapers a morning and would quiz us on  them
And I talked to Kerry about it and she was like âbut if you sold out presale it would have been chillâ
"I just remembered that when Sam cut that wire at AOC, Kyle was like âwe canât have you guys burning down the theater with 3 pre-sale ticketsâ"
Also presale is stupid? Just base it on actual sales
They canceled my block party show bc low presales and I tried to reschedule it like 3x and theyâve been ignoring me lol
Iâm sorry! @Jeff Braun  Lodge has been really weird lately about fun shows
I feel like people like him read a bunch of summaries of books
"I was going to say, I didn't know you interned at British community College"
he has the vibe of someone who canât read but probably reads more than all of us combined
i would love to see him write a book
Lmaoooooo
"oh no this is the guy to be clear

 https://youtu.be/A_4qELaY4Q4"
I think stand up is disappointing because most thoughtful art being destroyed is because it passes through so many hands with different agendas
Sorry for being annoying
"I understand the desire to consume things that let you turn your brain off but I wish there was more space for thoughtful art in the modern world - like, across the board music, books, film included"
Going to pour one out for Mark and David Graeber tn
RIP mark Fischer :(
Probably explains why like crowd work comedians (the bad ones) are also becoming more popular
yeah he was really good i liked him
like interrupting me in the middle of speaking to be like âuhmmm uhmmm yeah uhmmm this article was about uhmmmâ but like he had a point
Probably the most succinct and digestible piece of theory I've ever read
and he made fun of how nervous i got when i talked
I just got it today and am ripping through it I think it's excellent
heâs the guy who introduced me to the people in the office as jewish
What was he like?
Oh my god that's so sick
dude i interned for mark fischer in 2012
I think about my brother in law who likes Andrew Schulz and all that stuff and I guess there's some kind of wish fulfillment they get from watching that kind of comedy and maybe things that differ challenge them in a way they dislike? I suppose it's harder to relax when what you're consuming requires attention
"I think the lodge is also maybe only interested in short term and less likely to take chances than it was years ago, havenât they been losing a lot more money in the last few years?"
Or to rephrase why is alt comedy maligned rn even when we've seen it has potential to succeed within the current system
"Yeah I think it probably is, but itâs being diluted"
"But as the audience for comedy as a whole grows larger, you'd imagine the appetite for alt comedy would grow even just as a consequence of the law of large numbers"
And main stream viewers want to see stuff similar to stuff that introduced them into liking âcomedyâ which is largely right leaning unfunny podcasts
Itâs because comedy is becoming more mainstream
Bc I don't think people really like it
There is a proliferation of norm-core stand-up happening and I really can't figure out the cause
So true
Two most successful Lodge cast members of the last like 10 years are Sarah Sherman and Megan Stalter and theyâve created a space that wouldnât be accepting to either of them
Because the people who run these things think less of what they perceive as alt comedy
I feel like a lot of stand-up I see in nyc is homogenized
Idk why comedy as a whole has become so resistant to experimentation
Truly upsetting jokes aside that is annoying
Comedians You Should Know 2
Should have named the show Chicago Hot Dog
"Marry, fuck Tony"
Man this fucking blows sorry @Jeff Braun
What if you changed the name to koll tiny
Beg for one more chance and let me buy every presale ticket for February
Itâs on my list
Chicago method technique that WILL get you LAID
Thatâll catch some eyes
What about the free money Chicago method technique
Have you considered calling it âroast battle?â
"Maybe Hillarious, and a picture of Rodham Clinton in there somewhere"
Christmas we share
"If I find a spade You get custody on fridays, I get saturdays"
"Chicago method technique, hilarious"
Maybe throw a hilarious in the title
I have an awesome projector and am searching for small-medium rooms in spaces that are hungry for alt comedy
It kind of kills the point of a theater of independently produced show if you want everything to basically be branded the same as the laugh factory
The ironic part is the room was packed last night with walk ups and comps
reply with actually friday works for me and my show âOnly Fomedyâ actually
Send him this with dollar signs and question marks
Maybe see what she thinks about this??
âYour art and show name is driving away the kill Tony demographicâ
post this as a promo
So stupid
That kinda art attracts the right crowd for that kinda show
What a little bitch
Oh my god

Iâll sue
YOOOOO C900 IS A MOVIE
Yeah let's pretend it's the pandemic again

I too am sick i think there was a spreading at 50 first Sundays
Just AC installs ð
Did you guys crush open mics this week
No I donât think soâ¦ ð¤¢

Thatâs so true squad
Yes I am feeling better and can eat!!!!
Itâs going around like crazy rn
my intuition says youâre sick
Do you know anyone else that got it?
Probs norovirus
are you feelin better?
I canât tell if I had norovirus this week or go sick from sour gummies from Trader Joeâs
Hi
"My tenant wants me to fix his furnace, but he can wait"
I support you dropping and letting me do your spot
WHAT ATTITUDE IVE GIVEN YOU NOTHING BUT SUPPORT
Look at soon the vultures circle the infirm
Iâm not telling you bc I donât like your attitude
What show is it
Ugh I canât be sick Iâm in the middle of a crisis that only one great 10 minute set can cure
I NEEDED ACCOUNTABILITY
OR BEEN MORE LIKELY
I WOULD HAVE GONE PROBS
SHE SAID SHE WASNT
girl of course she is
WHAT THE HELL
CLAIRE SUNDBYE TOLD ME SHE WASNT GOING TO THE GAZZELLIES
Let him cook without seasoning ð
Need me to fill in?
Feel bad dropping but I canât imagine a show where Iâm more easily replaceable
I can make it
iâm so sad about it iâm doing so many fun shows this week
@everyone white guy spot open at Lincoln lodge
i coughed so much last week that now my vocal cords are really fucked
Dude Iâm actually turning my ass around I keep coughing
have fun at lodge yall- mommy is staying in tonight with a lost voice :((
ð¨no spoilersð¨
Can we please remember not everyone is caught up on traitors
adrienne youâve done such a good job
100 percent agree
Also people underestimate bachelor/bachelorette because they donât realize thatâs also a highly strategic social game
They always think theyâre smarter than they are
"Anyway, big brother players are sub par"
Once Lisa Barlow is on traitors itâs going to win an Emmy
I feel like this was said earlier in chat
and it was
Henry's gotta take a break for that one
I was just stanning my girl dorinda
I knew better
see
Well I didnât know about this
The traitors picked the obvious choice and Carolyn was saying it from the start
The Dorinda choice was a bad one
Ultimate respect âð¼
Dorinda could drink me under the table
I spit
When she was like âohhh theyâre sorry for getting less money just to make us more of a targetâ
THE HOUSEWIVES ARE SOOOOOO DUMB
Dorinda aside
Dorinda ruled
Keep Dorindaâs name out of your mouth
I said âwouldnât it be hilariousâ¦â
Henry told dmed me on the side and asked me to say that
I bet Robyn turns it up if she doesnât get murdered immediately
It's gonna make me question why you left your job at the haberdashery
It's so funny
It's really wild how dumd so many of the housewives are
"Hey brother, if your not cumming in caps"
Tonya is the best anti hero though
Tonka should be in Florida with his family
Bob the Drag Queen is my favorite this season
Yeah I was kidding
wait that was good!
It scared me
I donât know why cumming was in caps
"take away the emphasis, I remove my like"
I love Alan CUMMIMG
He made Tonya give up Tonka!
On Alan cumming?
You're making Joey say slurs
Just give Alan his flowers
Henry there's no point in doubling down
Stolen valor
I think Alan Cumming is getting credit for his outfits that I think the production team is designing
anyways I'm off to the lincoln lodge
Henry's not homophobic he just hates faggots
Ho Mo Phauxbic could be a good drag name
Excited to see her reaction
Gabby might find the smoking gun next episode
Sounding more homophobic by the minute
Yeah homophobes don't make sense!
heres what i love: gabby windey being the literal bachelorette and now not only being a lesbian but also seriously dating a standup comedian. i find her perfect & i hope she wins
Yes
"I donât think thatâs fair, I think bob the drag queen is the best character on the show"
Australia season two was terrible
And yes I HAVE seen the international versions
Alan Cumming is being so cunty and gay and not liking that is homophobic
mitchies there & he made it sound star studded
shut the fuck uppppppo
Is it an electrifying vibe at Godâs Lincoln Lodge tn?
if i made a real life traitors game could we play it at the garage @Johnbo Walter Stockwell
Sexist ass comedy show host forgot the names of the Flintstone's wives smdh
Laugh out loud big
At one breakfast Tom Sandoval has the biggest pit stains Iâve ever seen on tv
From s2
Commenting on the food is canon for traitor behavior
I love their inclusion of him in episode 3 was him just commenting on food lol
I want Ivar to just keep chillin lol
At this point only he could change my mind
I need @Mitchie âs take
Maybe Ian is a traitor? ð¤
It's weird having Ian side with me
Who knows maybe I'll chill and watch The Traitor
I'll bring my glowsticks
"Damn, gonna have to make an appearance it looks like"
"Anyways it sounds like a lot of the chat is in or busy tonight but if anyone was planning on stopping by the dj event later the address is

2625 N Central Park (come around back) and it's byob just fyi"
Spinoff host trying to stand out energy
Cmon
This something or other is iconic
Andrea maybe
You can't call her iconic if you idk her
Yeah but I bet everyone in the uk does
Alan is pushing too hard
You don't even know her name
Idk the UK woman but I can tell sheâs an icon
But you're just plain wrong here unfortunately
I appreciate you sticking up for the below the line hosts of the international seasons
And he was good in spy kids
The Alan cumming role being âiconicâ is erasure for the other international seasons that came before US and I wonât stand for it
And so many people biffed it
They had to run across floating platforms late in the game
And that was redeeming
"Jesus Christ, never come to my workshop again"
Like pure laughter
Season two though he was laughing so hard during one of the challenges
Sorry you're wrong
Wrong
I also think Alan cumming is annoying
i wanna be alan
Chat traitor is anyone telling the Joe Eames chat our secrets
wait yes!!!
Chat should have one big game of traitors
Chat should have traitors
OMG THERES A TRAITOR IN CHAT?????
If I made Rebecca watch every episode of every show WITH ME we'd never watch a damn thing
im a traitor
well john ill have you jnow mitchell left and im still letting it play
Thatâs married couple stuff
You gotta take that step as a couple
I donât co-sign that statement
"See, you gotta drop the requirement of watching together"
Dylan efron is proving to be the cleverest efron
All the traitors in one room strategizing is such bad play
we're only one ep in
The cliffhanger of the third ep is eating me alive
this is zac efron's brother erasure
I bet they do on YouTube
Someone should make a cut that excluded any mention of who is a traitor
I feel like voting him out or murdering him is just a waste of time so he will go far
Too much exposition
Truly the most secure spot as a player
Honestly a great place to be for n
Chrishell from selling sunset has ROASTED him a few times already
"I think heâs taken the role of âtoo dumb to be a traitor, but too unlikeable to strategize withâ"
Itâs awesome that heâs famous
Heâs one of the dumbest people on the planet
I need him to last till the end
Sandoval is the best of us
Sandoval and Britney Spears weird ex
Have to say that the straight white guy delegation did not send their best this season
ð
Just to piss us off maybe
Why hide that from the viewer?
I feel like they would have said that in the rules?
Iâm guessing they werenât allowed to say which number of doors from the left they were
Yo the way they're playing the door game is pissing me off
Tell her to send me pics anytime her dog shits
Give her my number
Did dog eat a burger
It looks like a burger patty
Hahahahahahahaha
my mom sending me pics of my 18 year old dogs diahreaheh
the eyes are so weird looking and the skin is too smooth!
why do they have a weird ai filter on all the confessionals
SHE LOVES TOO HARD
I'm a huge Ayan fan
"The monster is throwing the shoe, not shoe at monster"
"Sort of a reverse al-Zaidi situation, I'm afraid"
"Who is he, Muntadhar al-Zaidi??"
Was it with Kayley Horton
Caroline*
Heâs not even funny
And the faithful really fuck over someone at the end imo
"But also season 2 is kind of bad, the traitors make enormous mistakes"
"She has the street smarts of a career addict, not to be brushed aside"
She gets bullied by the nuero typical
Same thing happened to her in survivor
But sheâs high intelligent
Everyone underestimates Carolyn
I agree
3
3?
Which season
Absolute idiots
Huge mistake
Ok yup it was who I thought
Wait sorry I don't know yet
Need to talk bout dis
First murder was a mistake
Joe Kilgallon cheated on his wife then got really drunk and threw a shoe at lodge and they gave him a gazzelie for it
Just wondering why you didn't change it
Traitors rocks
Need a daily summary
Can I get the short and dirty of it all
The chat going crazy today what is going on
Why are we all harping on this
So itâs like
I already spelled it sow
Iâm trying to teach Andrew to respect women
Ok that's kind of what I thought ty
Kerry covered that with her joke I think
Sorry
Isn't it spelled sew
You guys could hit a couple open mics together or whatever
No I got my lovely gf a sowing machine for Christmas and she is also learning to sow
Klinger my fist will give you a free alteration to your Face if you try to do that
âhit you upâ you mean ask for free alterations ââââ
who are you going to hit up about reaping?
@Matty Merritt Iâm going to hit you up about sowing later
There's no set johnversation volume bc any johnversation will expand to fill up any room or container its confined to
But that's neither here nor there
Not a normal johnversation volume
Which is like a normal conversation volume
"Honestly I've been blasting music in there, and the loudest it gets outside is like 40 decibels"
You can't even tell it's the ac thumping on the roof when it starts spinning up
How sound proof is ur garage
"I got it to heat the garage and wouldn't you know, it's too cold for it to heat the garage!"
look at this puppy
INSTALLING
You're just taking away the crucial part of stand up
Or a monologue or a play
Well they have these it's called a one person show
how did we know this info from the gazelllies do we have someone representing us from the inside
"weâre holding vouch up my ass, hop in!"
I heard the crushes auditions are at laugh factory this year
SORRY LAUGH FACTORY
gonna start a rumor the netflix auditions are happening at crushes
I think so
Not when thereâs real housewives to watch
canât wait to hear about the trip!!
Both of those guys are way more talented and better than Iâll ever be but i just canât get into their comedy at all for that reason
is this the netflix is a joke thing
Jerrod is one of my favorites. The perfect amount of self indulgent
"I think drew michaels and Jerrod Carmichael too self indulgent on stage, but not untalented"
also im post covid comedy
I think it would make better lineups than cysk
"like why would
i know that guy"
well i think the whole thing is im a gen z girl
i feel like i just learned about the concept of absolutely not liking someone and liking their stand up
Make a new cysk called comedians Kristi has heard about
I think I would love his standup if he was like 15 percent less up his own ass
No way to know unfortunately John was fixing his ac
Iâm back in town. Did I win a Gazzellie?
He did a residency at the lodge a couple years ago and I kinda liked him despite all of the bad things Iâve heard
Speaks to his talent that he is successful when it is incredibly rare to meet a comedian that doesnt hate him
Not to be a contrarian drew michael type but i like drew michael's standup
And then they make it and itâs like oh yeah standup looks insane when thereâs no one laughing
Theyâre like why is no one doing this
All Iâm sayin is that someone has the idea to film a standup special w no audience every five years or so
(the joke was about killing myself)
I took Kevin bozemans class in 2013 and he came to give feedback and he liked one of my jokes
6 sorry
Five words for you buddy
@Cameron Gillette has more info
I remember when the HBO one came out he was on You Made it Weird (I was a different guy then) and Pete being so impressed and talking about how good the suicide joke was that it never had a punchline haha
Every story Iâve heard of him is so incredibly mean lmao. Cam is in love with him though
The thoughts do start get weird after a while though he's not wrong
When I moved to New York I told my landlord I was a comedian and she was like âDrew Michael lived here before youâ
I like his Comedy Central half hour quite a bit but I absolutely hate those HBO special so much
He'd hate that someone is asking that so much
Heâs the guy we would be talking about if this groupchat were set in 2018
Maria bamford did it better
Lmao
who drew michael
Lol was this entire special in front of noone?
Kilgallon got into fight with Drew Michael so I actually take back everything I said
God Drew Michael once showed up at wet cash and did like 30 after the booked headliner
https://youtu.be/BIfDSnJtPcg?si=h0_lkITddMuiZOHY
Why?
Also Drew Michael tried to sue them so thats probably why
Danny is a good guy leave him out of this
Haha I can see Dan Kallas' address on the trademark registration
canât wait to go home and watch the hangover with danny tonight
donât show up to CYSK tomorrow
haHAHAHA
Iâm gonna get hammered at lodge tonight and tell people that theyâll never do AoC
"thatâs actually really good 
(she says matter of factly, as if granting you permission on behalf of her gender to entertain your little idea)"
It would piss off Dan kallis so much
Hahahaha that would actually be so funny funny to do this
Tbh I think youâll hate it
Jokers you should know
JYSK AUDITION SHOW AT THE GARAGE FOR AoC????
Crushes audition show???
may the fours be with you ð¤£
Yeahâ¦yeah thatâs sounds about right
Opened with rape jokes
omg what did he say
But outside of that I heard it was a good time
I stg the shit y'all read
And guess what - he said a bunch of evil things and upset everyone
Also - the drama from the gazelles last night was that they had known monster Junior Stopka close it out
Pre-COVID CYSK was unreal
No more AC installs!!!
"I am reliable, I promise I'll get my act together!"
itâs awesome
awesome development at work my coworker broke up with his 13 year relationship and keeps asking to hold my hand
I dream of another show hosting huge auditions like that
Thanks manâ¦I needed this ððð
Pre-covid it was the hottest comedy room I'd ever seen. All the audition shows I did were like doing stand-up on easy mode
Scared the cats
Man this got a big laugh out of me
Itâs amazing
It seems like it was a really cool show!
hahahaahahahahaha
At that point you gotta introduce him as JoeDaComic
"They had a run where they were the coolest show when bar shows were the coolest thing and everything wasnt at 3 clubs, and i like the show because i'm old and sentimental about it, but it's funny when they expect new comics to care when it's as hit or miss as it's been"
and then chris trani was next in the lineup and i gotta say!! absolutely delightful
and then wouldnât really respond back to me
he was mad i didnât know him and asked his last name
he was really rude to me hosting laugh factory
Damn that's rough
Hahahahahaha
yeah we heard!
"Cysk was comically bad when I did it. Everyone ate shit until I went up (and yeah, I cooked)"
"Kristi and Joey, please do this for chrushes but to people at cafe mustache"
So funny to be in your 40s and have three kids and then yell at some 22 year old open micer that they wonât do your bar show
"In which case, uh oh"
Unless people like it here
Nooooooo not currently great show CYSK!!!!
My favorite part of that lodge story is that he walked up to random tables and told the people sitting at them that theyâd never do CYSK
Yeah he's an asshole
He's being a real shit head i would say
He got scary yelling at kayley to shut the fuck up at lodge
"Hey guys, I was away from the chat for a sec, weâre all still fans of my favorite standup Joe Kilgallon right?"
oh shit is that a good book i just found her wild ig
He has wild entitlement
Thatâs what I learned from reading All Fours
Meanwhile itâs almost always ok for a woman to have an affair
Just doing standup comedy alone gives her the right to he cruel to him
He has three kids with his wife who is a nurse
Esp with a kid due at the time Jesus christ
Heâs the piece of shit
No shade to Kayley the guy is a grown ass man and should know better imo
No judgement on her regardless of whatâs happening
probably
"There's an online test called ""is my wife mean enough for me to cheat on her"""
"If not true I feel bad for Kayley, she could just be collateral damage"
They call it the comedy vault because that's where the best scene secrets are stored
It's okay to cheat on your wife but only if she's mean enough
What happens at Zanies Rosemont stays at Zanies Rosemont
But I'm very good at making inferences
And I trust my sources
Someone saw him and his affair partner making out in the burbs
"Or like, I'm reading between the lines of Kayley Horton's stand-up and his podcast"
He wouldnât stop pressing for it
I can always count on you two to ingest all the local content
Iâve heard that itâs been confirmed
"Just got A flashback, when my mom died I told my rabbi I was too sad to do comedy and he kept insisting I host a roast of him"
Yes. It was covered on his and Jonah's podcast real heads know
I just seemed likely
Was cheating on his wife certified gossip?
I heard he was complaining about his wife being mean to him and itâs like - I wonder why!
Good to know I'm having a better time in New York than he is in Chicago lol
But here we are
Never thought I would have more respect for him as a comic than as a man
"Has a daughter, cheats on his wife, gets banned from the Lincoln Lodge trying to speed run getting blacklisted"
Dude the Joe Kilgallon arch this year has been unparalleled
People love awards season!
Iâm looking at the pictures and Iâm like wait why was everyone there
I wasnât there but i had people on the inside
Wait I just noticed the shoe in the picture
Yes
Is that what his award was for?
I for one wouldnât be celebrating getting so drunk at lodge that I threw my shoe at the window two weeks after my wife just gave birth but I guess thatâs just me
this line is a nod to the famous chat crossword
the first verse is about being a landlord
i cannot believe i missed the housewives/traitors chat ð­
Ur crazy gurl ð¤£
i accidentally changed the default reaction and then made it my whole brand ð¯
IS IT GOOD? IS IT BAD?
I DONT KNOW HOW TO TAKE IT
You're driving me nuts with the 100s
Ok this makes a lot of sense
like
literally me

Is Cindy short for Cindra? Or Cinderella?
Also no one expressed interest in Sunday!
The circumstances of my life have changed
More like the Brutalest
I hate how much Joey lies
Yeah!! Gonna figure out the time tonight!
No actually Joey lied heâs watching it right now. (But if you guys go Thursday I wanna come)
Meredith rocks
YOU ARE DISGUSTING
YOU ARE VILE
Hahahahaha that ruled
"The freak out about recording in the sprinter van, which is already being recorded anyways ð"
Keep logan weird âï¸
ohhh my god i just saw some guy eat shit on a lime scooter at the intersection of belden and st louis <3
they were like wuuuut the fuck
i did see them go to milwaukee that was awesome
The salt lake housewives always bring their a game
She also gets Bat Mizvahâd this season
waiiiit chrishell on traitors is awesome too
i love meredith
ok making it a point to catch up this weekend
Yes!
wait r u talking about salt lake
So very excited to see Dorinda
Sheâs been plowing through rh nyc
It was absolutely electric
I watched the end of this episode with Maggie itâs nuts
Tom Sandoval is providing so many laughs on accident this season
Meredith accused one of the girls of bugging her room
Which is the mark of a great season
Been screaming at our tv more than usual
Iâve been loving this season
I would say you don't have to but you really should bc it is really fun
and alienating people who haven't seen it <3333333
i love going to a party and finding someone else talking about a reality show <3333
something to look forward to ð«¶
i have really fallen off salt lake this season
"You donât need any background at all, very fun for  people who arenât even into reality tv"
I love the thrill of watching a weekly reality tv show it still does it for me
i fear i am gonna get into traitors this season too maddie
also gabby windy!!!!
"Wow Tom Sandoval and Dorinda and a random old Mountbatten ass royal on the traitors apparently, is it the kind of thing where you need to have watched before to appreciate it"
I think Joey is going Tuesday and Lucia and I talked about going Thursday!
They are a different breed
Thats true
The average American mind cannot handle meeting a real housewife in person
I didnât like having the civilians in the American traitors because they were just way too trusting
The British version does civilians which i do think is more compelling but less entertaining in a way
This one has a lot of fun survivor players too
"I know @Adrienne Stout is into it, lots of housewives"
Absolutely love that show
Gibbs start tonight
Havent seen the new season but as someone who doesn't care for reality tv too much this is as good as it gets for me
Ya it's basically just mafia but everyone is like a v good reality tv person
Wait this is like if Among Us was a TV show?????
I do still have a ticket for Sunday afternoon if you or anyone wants
I actually had to switch to today. Itâs intermission rn
"Is anyone watching the traitors, new season just premiered it rules"
"Is it just me, or is Cindy kind of..... BAD?"
cindy you are BAD
I joined a beginning sewing group on fb and its so awesome
I'm djing
Twyman core
Is there a move tonight ?
cite the property taxes in logan square
Counter sue your dad
you canât let him know. just tell color club not to budge. have your dad start litigation
itâs very sweet but now i have to tell him i just donât want him to see my set hahaha
Is there a Sunday viewing or the brutalist happening?
we have the same dad
i did not get purple for the right reasons but it worked out
"Connections

iâm opening for maggie winters tomorrow!!
make a wish everyone
"But doctor, I am poop fucker"
GET A HOME!
Sorry ð
No ð
John do you have to yell in the morning
It'd be so funny if I go through all this and my garage just burns down
I'm messing with propane heaters still
it's effective heating range is like 32Â° to 60Â°
IM SO ANNOYED
THE MINI SPLIT DOESNT HEAT VERY WELL IN VERY COLD TEMPERATURES
Think of how many high powered business deals can happen in that span of time
Thatâs ten New York minutes though
Yet some people can't be bothered to pay the fare smh
"Itâs crazy, like maybe a train will be 10 minutes late, but thatâs it and people just lose it haha"
Yeah dude the MTA runs like a machine. People in New York were always shocked when I would be like âyou have no idea how great this isâ
People in nyc love to complain about the trains and its like lol you mfers have never waited 30 min for the western blue line in the dead of winter
I'm seeing him at schubas in the wild for the first time ever
Weren't him and zako like fighting or something
What was the drama with Greg bartusiak a while ago?
I thought someone recited Ianâs poop fucker joke too close to a dry tree and the joke was too fire
Damn that was the last gazellies too
I'm gonna do this I think
At least you supported them financially
You can have a best tenant award
Hahahahahahahaha
IM SO SORRY
You gotta host the johnzellies in the garage
I was counting on you to livestream them!!!
I'm going to schubas
I WAS INSTALLING MY AC
FUUUUUCK
Hahahahahahahaha
I missed them
Hahahahahahaha wait the Gazellies are definitely over
I think it's maybe just a good reflection of the effects of prolonged lack of investment of resources in infrastructure and public goods combined with climate change stuff
Lol I'm running late
I want Gazellies updates
I donât personally understand how there are so many different separate fires at the same time in separate spots.. like are they all connected? or if it is that easy of phenomenon right now due to the Santa Ana wings so it is truly happening everywhere with big vegetation
My brother said the same thing that they think the winds were strong enough to blow transformer and spread the spark. Also there had been two years of wet winters creating an abundance of growth that was all super dry at this point from 8 month drought. Transformers blew in my brothers area so they are still without power but no fire
Wait until theyâre over and then pop off I think
It is funny but maybe
Yeah my brother lives in North Hollywood and says the winds are insane. I think at some point the air gets so hot that any existing fire spreads super easily
"makes sense, itâs so so scary"
But I'm assuming events like that are springing up all over and the winds are just spreading to too fast
Is it insensitive to make a video where I show how tired I am after sucking all the LA firefighters dicks
And oxygenating them
And the wind has been blowing the fire to a ton of other places
And the sparks caused a fire bc everything is so dry
A friend who lives in Santa monica said winds ripped part of a roof off a building and hit a transformer or something
I think in some places up to 100mph
And there have been lots of winds gusting all over
Not sure of the exact cause but it is so unbelievably dry out there
is it like wind and heat combo
ok my dumb question is iâm confused how the fires are starting
"1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW
Washington, DC 20500"
667 evergreen ave brooklyn 11207
"Plz drop addresses for Christmas card, I finally got them @everyone"
can i ask a dumb question
I do a bit with that sorta tho
Itâs called having a refined chat voice
I literally havenât once
THE GAZELLIES!
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT!

I refuse to do any crossword that isnât at least a 15x15 grid
yeah iâm done i got 4
I don't think I want to keep trying this even as a bit
17 across is preworkout
18 across is really brilliant
and did you know septic tank doesnât end in an e
do you spell it electriciy
john have you ever heard the word electricity
it's so funny
I'm actually laughing so hard at this crossword

Might as well be a guess the answer puzzle
I hate these crosswords where each word only overlaps with one or two others
Explain your thesis behind this you absolute nimrod
I'd like to see some of you rentoids come up with a better crossword puzzle
explain that
How so?
Electrical doesn't even make sense for some of the clues it's the answer for
alright alright sorry!
im actually doing it rn
HOW IS LANDLORD WAGES NOT OBVIOUS???
i dont need any hints
"3 of the answers are ""electrical"""
Here's a hint
this is too easy iâm insulted
2 across is fork
I think you would have to experience years of concussions to make sense of John's clues
completely impenetrable
thereâs nothing wrong with thinking a lot and itâs okay no matter what society tells u

Could make money on that I assume?

God bless you
I can't believe you didn't quit the day after trump got elected and your boss was singing three little birds to the whole office
I sincerely wish they had just fired me
I'm sorry Joey
I cuss out the very nature of this company once a day and that's with a very minimal workload
I'm not about to start working hard for this company
my manager quit at Same Day
Did this happen at same day?
Why does this keep happening to you
he has seniority over me and they just kind of expect me to take on all the work load. Mr Hanley will learn to regret which of the customer service fellas they fired
they're firing my coworker tomorrow which is such bullshit that I won't be coming into the office again and am looking for a new job asap

can I ask why this is cool though

goodreads is the only platform where i can see one of my exes rate toni morrison books 3 out of 5 stars. awesome website!
i famously do goodreads
I do Goodreads. I think the layout of bookworm is a lil goofy
Iâm using bookworm and the only thing I donât like about it is the other users
Okay I'll just keep what I'm reading to myself then lol
That being said who cares
Goodreads is not a useable app and is owned by Amazon
I should try to be a Hasan Piker Type
And just debate anyone who voted for Donald Trump
U should start a Tiktok debate page
So ur saying I should join?
A lot of misinformation and racism
Bookworm seems like the x of book websites
Should I join goodreads or bookworm?

"It was a good movie, entirely without self reflection"
That never happened

They remembered how to make movies
Nosferatu was sick
Free Ukraine
"Honestly agree, that whole conflict pisses me off"
Just overheard someone in a coffee shop in Brooklyn say we  weren't aggressive enough against Russia during the Ukraine conflict lmao
they made us all introduce ourselves like we were in mickey mouse club house as the intro it was so bad
i think my coworker is mad at me
i made every scene about drinking and driving

"Nosferatus warning, sailors in mourning"
"Nosferatus delight, sailors at night"
but I genuinely don't think any one of us could have come up with something as funny as Nosferatu's Delight
ok look I hate AI
@Meta AI imagine I took 1/3 of an edible for nosferatu but I looked at the box and it says this is the kind of weed that makes movies real

Iâve been doing more improv again and I love it
This is healing
Chat is really reaching across the aisle here
Itâs fun to do standup tbh
never meet your heroes
Also so fun to do standup at improv shows
Whatâs the moral
my brother took an improv class at u chicago and two girls were paired in a scene where one wound up peeing in a bucket. like the teacher had to stop her and say âdonât actually pee in the bucketâ and the girl responded âbut i want to.â and then the two girls in the scene fell in love in real life.
to do not watch
improv is so fun
and now itâs tonight
and i was like yeah!
i feel crazy my coworker is an improviser and asked me at work to do her improv show

There are a few things that frustrated me but I still enjoyed
iâm so frustrated that he went back in the game
I just finished it
We should have had a substance chat
If anyone wants my contrarian takes on squid game or the substance dm me separately
I hated season 1 tbh
anyone else watching. squid game season 2
but schubas is on
making soup rn gonna watch sex lives of college girls
Also valid!
itâs a mental illness def but not one iâm willing to dissect
"Good move I think, no need to do a show while sick, it never ends up being worth it really"
i literally canât make my brain think iâm not banned from a show when i drop
i did drop tightship iâm definitely sick
Yeah she actually made me make that post in photoshop and pass it around different group chats
"Youâll never get on tight ship again, even if youâve been on multiple times and they for sure asked you"
suz just told me they posted that as a marketing scheme
wait so like i heard that schubas is on
can someone go to schubas and check?
Yeah itâs embarrassing to go
Hmmm  I think there is no Schubas tonight
I canât be seen there itâs social suicide
Careers will be made and dreams will be shattered
It's the event of the year
You gotta go
I donât know if I can go but I would get tacos with people across the street at antique taco
Iâm avail

Next Thursday
When is it?
It's at a den of something
Hopefully Bad Comedy wins best podcast so I can see mack Nepper give a speech
John if youâre going I think Iâll go
might pass
as much as I love celebrating dead eyed straight guys who make comedy their whole personality despite not seeming to enjoy it much
I think thereâs a half off promo
I'm sure I could probably get in free but I want them to keep doing it
jfc
A nice lil $20
Yup!
is it at the Den again?
Alright I'm buying my tickets
And he's just ranting
They brought out someone that's just the CEO that got murdered lol
It's really rough lmao
And it's making me think of the Gazellies
I'm just watching the roast of 2024 on Netflix
as a family
we could January 6 the Gazellies
I kinda wanna be there for the drama
"The gazellies are January 9th, anybody wanna go?"
will i die if i donât go to tightship tn
but my throat hurts xD
i hate dropping shows
u know what i already know the answer actually NVM poll cancelled
i feel like kinda sick but not dying

I am staying in and practicing the future kazoo
@Joey D Bednarski this would be a great night for you to learn the flute part to mask off

Are you working that night
I could do that
9:30 or after maybe
Wut time
Does anyone want to go see nosferatu on Friday evening
I volunteer my mouth for #3 ð
I also gotta think about social media and such
"I do want to hear your thoughts, but it might be a little while before I put them into action. It might make more sense to hold off until I'm in a place to put them into action. First and foremost my focus is just getting baseline operational stuff finished. 
1. Seating, need 40 folding chairs 
2. Heating, need a heating source that won't potentially suffocate audiences (probably gonna get a minisplit)
3. Shitting, gonna set up a piss hole or something"
@Aaron Klinger @Johnbo Walter Stockwell I have gone down the qlab wormhole and am fascinated with light cues
I've had it it's good
"It would be fun, Iâll come over and weâll look at everything then figure out best budget solutions"
Would like an Ian take and review
I heard their vanilla ice cream is stupid good
"Sure! I have a pretty simple setup right now that only allows for me to turn the stage lights on and off. And it's a combination of track lights that I use for fill, and two spot lights"
@Johnbo Walter Stockwell could I help lighting design your venue
Iâm killing an hour in jc licht with a baby
that would be funny too
hahaha probably a small one
Can you fit a uhaul
"But I also want to do that as a punishment for agents of chaos, where I'm like, ""I'm gonna go park my car"", and then the garage door opens"
Rebecca wants me to do a thing where I do a set on the car and then she drives it out of the garage
hahaha
What if your first show is a roast battle between this chat and Joe eames chat
It would be so funny to have them come to the first show

John is your garage classed as an entertainment venue
"if something isn't up to code, or seems fishy, you can tell the city about it and get an inspector to come by!"
you do have the power to report your landlord's code violations!
To fill out a form that would increase their property taxes
To threaten landlords
By renters
Is an under used incredible tool
What this is
it's lit
and ask them questions about this shit
I found out I can just do the property tax appeal through them
"Also, I pay like $7 a month for a benefit with my work that basically gives me legal representation for free"
these fuckers have no idea what they're dealing with
I'm a prophet

"Some of them are listed as having an unfinished basement, and then simultaneously have a basement apartment listed on like apartments.com"
ur single handedly taking down fishman i like it
"And it's not like, these are some down on their luck elderly people who aren't making good money anymore. These are all multi-unit buildings, without senior-exclusions, that aren't listed as having a garage or a finished basement, when all of them do"
not all of it but some obvi
$12 a month??? thats my BEER money
these people have too much money on their hands
"thats actually good can u get some of my neighbors on the other side of kimball, i just got strong armed into signing up for composting"
"fuck you, you're gonna be a good neighbor"
"Honestly, exactly"
"in a way, you're forcing community"
"So I'm basically paying more than some of my neighbors, when, by all appearances, they should really be paying much more."
"Yes, exactly"
oh and like others pay more
"So, if a property is assessed at a lower value than another property, they pay less in taxes"
"Every township in chicago is basically given a chunk of the city budget that their taxes are responsible for paying. Each individual property in that township is then assessed at a specific value to determine the individual amount for which that property is ""responsible to pay"" which is their ""property tax"""
i just genuinely am curious
no shade
like narcing on ur neighbors
wait but actually what do you get out of it haha
it's absurd
They just get to pay less in taxes
"if they don't report to the system that they've added a garage, or finished the basement, there's no repercussions"
Heâs literally raising the rents on other landlords
and it relies on property owners self reporting when there are changes in the characteristics of the properties
Heâs a landlords landlord
"Like, they use an automated data model to estimate the value of all the properties"
"In all genuineness, it's kindof bullshit how the property tax system is setup"
Just when we thought you couldnât get any more likeable
blood will flow in the streets
I'm declaring war on Logan Square
"Currently working on finding out how to submit ""property characteristic errors"" to the assessors office so my neighbors pay more in taxes"

THIS IS WATER
Teach standup in your garage
Landlord that teaches standup for lots of money in garage would be so cool
NO DEATH IN MY GARAGE
So whatâs this then
NOPE ðââï¸
It doesnât make sense in other venues
Can I do a bit where I kill myself by leaving the car running with a garden hose
I HAVE VACUUMED UP ANY AND ALL DUST. IT DOES NOT EXIST IN THIS SPACE.
My only thought is maybe did we consider the dust
The brick wall looks great
I did some estimating and it seats about 40
"Garage is pretty much good to go, baby!"
My shift was lowkey not goated
til theyâre done
i guess donât tell people the ideas u care about
like its def been done before but yeah it feels too close to home and weird timing
of someone else to do it first
yeah thatâs a unique idea and definitely not cool
That sucks tho I'm sorry
Sounds like she just had some smoke and mirrors deflection move
i like did in a way!!! yeah idk i feel weird and annoyed
itâs like too late now but normal to be seething
oh yeah i think u should have said something then
and i was like hey! and she said that weird thing about how itâs different
like 2 weeks ago
idk i guess drag queens are just used to stealing ideas tho lol
when did you find out?
i feel like itâs tooo late?? like sheâs doing it tonight and probs rented the uhaul already
like why not
i think u should actually tell her itâs not cool with you
this is worse than immediately after i started comedy every single comedian started joking about dating
Jk not drama just undeniable inspiration I feel like? But also anything goes I spose
truthfully iâm gonna be a bit annoyed bc i feel like im gonna see like 10000 insta stories being like âneutral gena is a geniusâ
Thatâs like real housewives style comedienne drama
I think thatâs pretty crazy
and i was like ????
and she was like no what iâm doing is marketing what ur doing is art
Roadkill presents: labyrinth
she like told me in the office sheâs doing it and i was like woah whereâd u get that idea
iâm having a headliner in westys
Or see if u can find a place with a bunch of storage lockers and set up diff comics in them
You should drive the you haul to a storage locker and have the headliner in there
i was like gonna film my special in summer and have her open for me
I had an idea recently for road kill
anyway you all are invited to my show in a the moving guys truck
Yeah that's a little too close to home if u ask me
i would ask her
idk iâm not the first one to do a show in a uhaul
i mean iâve had the roadkill idea for like two years almost at this point and have been talking to her about it forever
itâs like theyâre doing a grand entrance in a uhaul
Id feel weird!! Is the show happening in the uhaul and have they ever talked about it before
i donât own the idea but i guess sheâs like going around the office saying she thought of it before me????
should i feel weird that netural gena is like renting a uhaul for her show tn at boots
thatâs a really good one
more road head and go worldwide
what are you guys putting down can i copy of you?

Damn everyone's getting punched on the bus except me :(
I deserved it though I was on my way to Second City
some kids did that to me on the bus a couple years ago
you didn't give me time to guess?
Throat bite

"When you immediately resort to wrenching their balls off and biting their stomach, it's over"
"See, so many people assume you're fighting on fair playing field"
Are you kidding me
I will HAPPILY bite another man
thatâs how you reeeeaaallly get em
Itâs all about biting
"But I was sitting down too, pretty stuck"
"Hmm, I'd think twice maybe"
Iâd say at least
Or bigger
Was he John sized?
I'd kick a dude in the face like a horse
"I was facing forward in a seat and he came from behind, I didnât know it was happening or else I would have! But he was huge, Iâm not fucking around with that"
Like a fucking donkey
I'd start kicking so fast
"Honestly so many people feel obligated to use their hands in a fight, but buddy, on a bus, your hands are for elevated your legs to kick people in the face"
"Let me be the first to say, happy new year"
Hahahahahaha
I was listening to ABBA
"No, he got off and when I left I went to the bus driver and was like âI donât know if this matters, but a guy punched me. Ok have a good dayâ"
Hahahaha imagining you on the phone on the bus just immediately after getting punched calling the cops and explaining the situation while making eye contact is really funny
Did you call the cops or anything?
Hahahahaha
"And you know what? Selfishly, I wish he stayed in!"
He was big and just got out of jail (which he yelled)
Gotta be the bus alpha
Bus Beta
It would be funny if you and me went clubbing
And can I say? Cheugy!
Some guy starting yelling about someone touching women and I was in a single seat with no one in front of me and then he punched me
Me!!
"Guys, guess who got punched in the back of the head on the bus yesterday?"
"gang, we gotta rally"
OH FUCK

This and the Bob Keen comment that Caroline posted are really the main highlights

Also jumping into say Mike brought me to a Wisconsin gig to bully me lol
Through fb
Working canât scroll
Am I missing anything from today
Can you guys send screenshots of everything
Which was an incredible run
The year Bob turned 40 he got punched in the face twice
gena does for sure!
Somebody's gotta have the pic of the blood
He had like eight drinks went outside and faceplanted
*what did the sidewalk do to him?
What did he do to the sidewalk?
And the sidewalk outside Lincoln lodge
Looking forward to seeing this develop
So far I know Bob Keenâs personal axis of evil includes Mike OâKeefe and the Coleâs managers
"i wish i dated more creeps when i was 25, could have been so awesome"
Now he seems awesome
without a doubt
He wants to be the guy to date 25 year olds
Honestly thatâs probably why OâKeefe sent that message
i hate that
TJ has been nothing but nice to me personally but every time Iâve had a conversation with him - he opens with âso Iâm dating a couple of 25 year oldsâ
Bob keen going there!
the algorithm is aware
lmao
that being said TJ has been on are we dating the same guy in a major way
I've barely interacted with him but heard a half dozen stories about him assaulting someone
i wasnât really around for the okeeefe era but it seemed crazy
Many such cases
Just bottled up resentment over not reaching the heights you have known you were destined for since you were 22 or whatever
It will only fuel the fire of the bad open micer
But he wasnât wrong about his act
Especially if youâre Mike O Keefe
Iâm against sending that type of message to anyone out of principle
Whereas Mike sees himself as a true journeyman of the craft and TJ as an interloper hence the rage
Heâs terrible
Wait who sent the text
Iâve only been universally praised for my comedy which is why I do it so infrequently
guys this happens to everyone right?????????
his online behavior is odd
guys... right?
I think he's probably fine but moreso knows a lot of people and gets them to go to his shows
its a badge of honor
"happened to me after every show, its part of the evolution"
we should all post our screenshots of bookers who told us to quit in solidarity
Like was Mike right to send that to him lol
We talked a bit about this yesterday but I am curious if TJ is any good at comedy
this is awesome
like i can never tell if the person im talking to is on the subway or in a library
i kind of hate the noise cancelling feature on apple stuff

didn't mean to change name sry unpinned a message.
"My hope was to refinance this year, but now that Trump is in office long term interest rates are going up"
"I'm not gonna increase rent this year, but like fuuuuuuck"
But the bank increased my mortgage soon after that by about $500 which put me in an even less comfortable position
I had to increase them when I bought the property so they'd actually cover a reasonable amount of the mortgage. And even then we were paying a bunch on top to make the mortgage.
But it would put me in a position where I definitely wouldn't need to increase them for a long while
"Yeah, totally not saying rents would necessarily decrease"
"I have this print setup that makes a lot of imperfections in the gobo I'm projecting on the wall, and it looks super sick"
Look at how sick this gobo looks that I made to project onto the garage
Yeah landlords are always getting tax breaks and passing that on to their renters

I can't help but feel like this location specifically is a political thing.
show them this
"There's one property near me that is worth like 1.1M (that one that sold in 2014), and it's been assessed at 660K"
"I'm like feeling motivated to gather more broad data on this, like this is pissing me off so much"
iâll clear this up
cc me
itâs based on value
yeah you should be right actuallyâ itâs not based on sale price in illinois
I'm paying 96% in taxes
"And that's the other thing, a property that sold a month before mine is paying 87% in taxes based on its sale price"
I shouldn't be penalized for buying a property in the area more recently than a bunch of other people in the area
"They're assessing the values of all these properties at 80% of the value of my own home, when the assessed value on public real-estate listings are all between 95%-110% the value of mine"
yeah that sucks. idk i unfortunately have heard the sale price holds a lot of weight with these things but im no expert
I wouldn't have an issue with it if they didn't also assess the value of all the properties in the area
"Sure, and that's a fair way to assess a property's value!"
i think what theyâre saying is itâs based on the sale price. which idk if thatâs true or not but that sounds like what theyâre saying
"just like public documentation showing what it looks like inside, etc"
Or similar
But they all either have public rental listings
"None of these comparable properties have been sold in the past 30 years, except 1 that sold a month before mine, and 1 that sold in 2014"
"They have a tool that you can actually really easily find comparable properties to your own. And it's based on proximity, age, size, and classification. So like, comparable would be basically any property within a certain distance with very similar characteristics."
like when you say comparable you mean they sold for a similar price?
comparable as in their recent selling price?
That's how this works!
Or I should be paying less!
"OK, so, if that's the case, all of these other places should be paying more!"
"I gave the property tax appeals office this very thorough property tax appeal, that cites multiple comparable properties that are all paying about 80% of the property taxes I'm paying. And they denied my appeal by saying, ""yeah, but your property sold for this amount recently"""
wait what happened
This property assessment thing is really pissing me off.

What if I said I want triple crown
"I'm feeling kind of sick right now, probably not gonna make it to lunch brunch"
Maddie your contributions are always incredibly insightful and always appreciated
"QXY is not big round lazy Susan style tables itâs two tops and four top style but I have seen them pushed together to make six never 10, thatâs my contribution to the boys brunch"

I have done incredible amounts of mental damage to myself by listening to these
https://youtu.be/v9oMcW0i6T8?si=GH4HLrqW5saFzZiA
I understood you but wasnât about to help you in this act of self harm
Roast Battle also has a podcast
i feel like u were the only one who understood me in these four minutes
thank u mitchell
He has interviewed over 150 Chicago comedians and most of them will probably be people you hate
This is Mitchâs speciality

Most of it is behind a paywall now
I have all his episodes downloaded if you want any John

Proud of you girl you should do The Alchemist next

My all time favorite moment from a Chicago comedy podcast is when he asked Michael Cooper âwhen did you realize you were so intelligentâ
"Sorry, just keeping folks abreast"

And I listened to Aaron chases podcast where he interviewed Mar McFly and he made up some story about how he had a threesome with two lesbians on a beach"
"the lady who used to cut my hair said she went on a date with a comedian and when i asked who she said ""mar mcfly"""

collin unger told me he was on too many shrooms to defend her but watched it happen hahaahahah
His name isnât really Mar McFly right
He so good at it
Mitch appearing out of the woodworks to shut in bad comics is my favorite thing
never met him but i know he was shitty to victoria
One time he tried to roast me after the roast show and I said âyou have to say hello firstâ and he got weird
hahahahahaha
Mar McFly should only be posting things like âremember when standup was just bombing for five minutesâ
bunch of g's
and he can't figure out how to stop it
"rebecca's dad is complaining to me that when he shares something to himself, he gets two separate texts"

My dad sent a super ominous message to my family group chat that he âwants everybody at the house by 4 pm tomorrow to talk about some family stuff before people come over for the party.â
Is so funny
Anne Clank
This is what I'm the New Yorker needs to write an article on
"When I walked into Skibidiâs apartment, I was shocked at how neat it was. Tasteful art on the wall, including an original Rothko. We sat down and he spoke eloquently about the importance of the comfort of his home, and why he thinks spending money on art is worth it. 

âSkibidi dop dop dop yes yes,â he said with a little smirk. Then he added âSkibidi taupled dip deip.â We both got emotional."
Fuck
Lol
KIDDING

Ok apparently I was messing with folks associated with the yakuza
We're still in the investigation phase of this tho
Idk maybe around 830 or 9ish.
What time? That place always makes me feel overstimulated but maybe Iâll wear over ear headphones like a baby who shouldnât be at a concert
@Ian Erickson i am on board for this type of evening
I think me and Kari are investigating the possibility of a Logan arcade sort of evening
Im always trying to get him to come to chicago and do shows but it seems chicago has come to him which is so beautiful

Eric Sony and Hypnosis set the nickname for Andrew Shankland to Mr. Android.
I have something then
today
due to the meeting
so if i donât respond donât take it personally on account of iâm just busy
just a heads up everyone today iâm gonna be super busy cause i have a meeting at 1-1:30 and am gonna be thinking about it before and reflecting on it after
i always read it as short for twink
Kids at school are calling me mr. Android because of my busted ass phone
Gonna start saying this to my cat
Chicago sky player kamilla Cardoso is playing in China and this is a quote from her coach lol
Itâs also the title of a Beatles song!
which is likeâ¦ so donât come to school tomorrow vibes???
and itâs âtomorrow never knowsâ
but then i looked up what tnk stood for
just got asked to open for parkerâs show at the TNK fest
Sargon of Akkad
There's only one TRUE king of the world
WTF
Nobodys here except Kristi
You wonât believe how sober everyone was
Yall will never believe how great it went
IM GONNA SHOW OFF MY NEW POLO SHIRT
sure why not
Me and Rebecca exchanged Christmas gifts
SHOULD I COME TO COLES STIL
Sounds like you just got a condo on Live Your Life Boulevard
iâm like what the hell
he just bought me another one
awesome vibes here on kms ave
rovaughn hill just stole my vodka soda
On the corner of KMS avenue and the boulevard of broken dreams
Iâm gonna go to Coles around 9:30 and have the best set of my life
wow this set at lf just made me go on kms ave
Who goin Coleâs
Iâll be there running around like a gopher for the social media team lol
It was a funny joke that would've aged just really perfectly but I wasn't sure if this was a situation where maybe you weren't wanting that sort of joke so I decided I'll just keep it to myself
Pinball sounds cool!
Where?
I can't I'm going to a pinball convention that day
Why you delete
Anyone want to go to a Chicago wolves game on Jan 4?
Itâs mono red aggro
Might delete it
Anyone want me to do this for their linkdn
Gonna keep it
Hmmmmm
Unless the dating meta has shifted
Might come off as a little too strong
I'd say maybe
Hard to say
Is this too much for hinge
"True, but if itâs bad at the start, usually stays hard"
I feel like I usually see them the other way
That was what made me think it was kind of noteworthy tbh
Itâs not supposed to be like that
Sometimes stuff like this is all about perspective
"Not so crazy now, huh"
Took a live by mistake leave me alone
But there is a car fully upside down in front of scofflaw
No I had to take the picture on the sky and I thought it turned out
Ah shit
thatâs what i was gonna say girl
"bisexual movie star voted for ""No"" in the poll."
"SpongeBob, father of one voted for ""No"" in the poll."
bruh ððð
Andrew I'll just say this:
"Jeff voted for ""No"" in the poll."
Leaving it up so I can learn to sit my ass down and listen
Donât like that riff
On the red pill network
I'll be back in chicago next weekend
Only if it's a podcast
I have been working out some ideas
Lmk if you wanna talk about women as a whole one of these days on a google video hang
"Yeah, like I feel like communication is actually one of the difficult parts of a relationship that isn't good after 4 dates and takes work but w/e"
also early breakups suck bc i feel like nobody knows how to say âhey just not feeling itâ
And add each other on Linkdn
All you gotta say is itâs not the right connection
After four dates
Citing specifics for why something isnât working is a red flag
"the lil beekeeper's son voted for ""No"" in the poll."
"A Brooklyn heartache is required within the first few months, you juuuuust squeaked it in!"
Yeah see I thought this was a thing we had going for us lol
also this is a bad time to announce iâm gonna go no sugar diet in january and id love to have a great dinner with everyone before the year is over!
"but overall andrew u donât want someone whoâs just picking u apart instead of working with you, seems like they have some communicating to do themselves"
"It's super weird being a people pleaser with a person who is sending mixed messages like that, makes you feel a lil nuts"
I stand by it
Hahahaha
oh come on say it
"Nevermind, I am actually chill"
"doorcam voted for ""No"" in the poll."
God I just feel so Autistic
i for one like a vent sesh and am happy to help
Is this true about women?
"Appreciate the kind words folks, sorry to put this in the chat instead of my regular brand of proactive comedy"
Amen!!!!
more importantly women will always find a reason to be mad at u
"You didnât do anything, she just wasnât the person for you and thatâs ok! It sucks for sure, but you didnât do anything wrong"
People donât get less difficult the more you know them
I think itâs perfectly reasonable to be confused if just think of this as saving you a lot of figure grief
itâs giving bpd no shade
Especially at the start!
things should be easy! not confusing and hard
Iâm saying it was maybe not worth it considering itâs been confusing the whole time
My vote is not in regards to your situation I just think you are one of the few people in the chat who shouldnt ever be confused and it is wrong if you ever are
"Yeah, we were like having a perfectly fine night and then she kinda just broke it off and started citing all these small weird moments we had"
"Mitchie changed their vote to ""No"" in the poll."
but also this kind of pattern this early on? maybe ya dodged a bullet
"Mitchie voted for ""Yes"" in the poll."
no i would be genuinely so confused
"Oh yeah, no I feel like she was giving off mixed signals this whole time. And also sheâs just been weird in general, like the night she randomly seemed pissed at me before Iâd spoken to her despite nothing having happened between us and then she was fine the next time I saw her"
"Eric Sony and Hypnosis voted for ""Yes"" in the poll."
"Samuel Housing Authority voted for ""No"" in the poll."
bacon egg and cheese created a poll: Is Andrew wrong for being conf...
clear sign that your communication skills need work
I thought this would be a poll
Am I wrong for being confused by this?
"And also doesn't want to text, which is a boundary I've been respecting."
The girl I've been seeing ended things with me last night and she said it was because we aren't communicating well. But we've been on like 4 dates and she specifically told me she wanted to take it slow.
Id consider it the main point of the chat
Go off
Can I poll the chat on a question about my personal life please?
Itâs the busiest Costco in the Midwest

What's everyone doing rn?
Ok I'm off until January 1st
Did it spill over the rail
The balcony
Onstage?
"Imagine I get onstage and fall right over, cheetos spilling everywhere"
If the audience were good I would have swept them up myself and used them for my entrance
Ok last night I saw a man at LF trip and spill a bag of cheetos and it truly made me laugh harder than any comedy show
Iâve heard mixed things
How was it
at a y2k screeening and itâs empty
I submitted a bunch of old ones to the treasurer and it still hasnât cleared
You might be able to cash that in directly to the bank to avoid the treasury
They take so long to cash in
Just not like dying laughing or anything
Audience is listening
It's not bad!
13!
How many audience members are there @Johnbo Walter Stockwell ?
WHAT THE SAM HELL!
The important thing is that the comedy show continues even if itâs bad and nobody wants to be there
Cowboys been tucking himself in recently
"I feel so bad dude, the energy in here is rough"
And I thought she was hosting but maybe she's not ð¤ð¤ð¤

The Hangover: Joker 2

"Apparently someone said it was 12 o'clock and a kid yelled ""fuck 12"" lmao"

Was it good? I want to see it
think iâm gonna see it tn!
is y2k any good?
Gah every pic of her goes hard
Missing her
Yeah that's the worst part
Ya and I think opposition is doubling coming down on him and trying to make his shortcomings more of a thing to point to never electing like a teacher or left leaning guy again
But that's kind or more vibe based than anything
I also think maybe he wasn't the best choice for CTU to tap for the nomination and he's having the pay the price for not being a food enough politician to do the job well
It's really good
Anybody play chants of sennaar
Become a comedian?
I think with Brandon Johnson a lot of people (on both sides of the issue) arenât loving how heâs handling the migrant crisis
I think @Anthony Siraguse said he surrounded himself with a bad/incompetent team
I feel like he's doing not a great job overall but also all the videos I see of him and the comments are def heavily pushing an agenda
"Love the vibe, but I'm neutral on the taste"
IDK about the Brandon johnson stuff
Diet Coke propaganda has been everywhere lately
Iâd be right there with her ð«¶
"I saw someone yelling at the meeting today, and I was like, ""where's this coming from?"""
Lisa Barlow marches on Washington
Is it holding up pension payments?
I don't get that part
"Yeah, but like why do normal people care?"
Itâs like how rfk said heâs going to get rid of Diet Coke as soon as trump is inaugurated
he keeps holding off the budget
Does anyone know why emotions are high with Brandon Johnson?
No it's bc tiktok is where everyone is finding out about genocide and they don't have control over the flow of information in the same way
I'll have an update for you tomorrow on progress
I started working on em today
Hahahahahahahaha
They found out how much storage space they were paying for when they saw all the unread Tik Toks in John and Aaron's inbox from me
But who knows
I feel like Congress sees it as more of an existential risk if China has access to that data
iâm gonna go non verbal
no one should be allowed to benefit from your data unless they work for a good old fashioned american company
this is happening to protect you from china
why
wait why is this happening to us
"Oh man, chat is gonna have a rough week"
it is so much worse than tt it's kinda crazy
no ik that's why I was trying to figure out reels
i have like a severe addiction and idk how iâm gonna handle being cold turkey
wait this is like really not good for my whole thing i got going on where i lay in bed and watch tiktokâs until danny gets worried
it's truly bullshit
And weâre all headlining
Yup!

Are you sure it's only $80?!
You know someone about to end up in the ER for sticking they dick in this
Wait so it was like a 30 year bond???
That's so funny

My mom is sending me a $50 savings bond from when I was born now worth $82
Huge score
Yes you should it will be very well received by the public
it's pretty funny
I probably will
Rebecca told me to!
I think the comments will be really fun
You should post this video of your wife crying while you laugh and videotape her
And came to me like this yesterday
Rebecca was reading the invisible life of addy la roux
It was either you or another girl who only reads about Neurodiversity
Caroline I added you on Goodreads
One was just her Goodreads burner account
I had to stop bc it was proving difficult to keep it straight from my ooze and muck fear tracking app
stopped using goodreads bc the app is quite bad
i searched for you on goodreads & there were two caroline twymans. took a lot of detective work to figure out if you were the one who just read Hunger Games or the one who read Women in Tech
https://www.goodreads.com/friend/i?feature=friend-invite-url&invite_token=NjZlYmZjMzUtNDFiMi00NGM4LWI0NDgtM2EyZmQ3NDhjYzhl
Looks like Avi has a lot more going on internally than his pa

Thank u kings
Or a screw extractor
Iâll look for pliers
And thank you WAYFAIR
Ohhh good idea thank you !!
"Since the threads are exposed on the opposite side, easiest solution might be to grip it with pliers on that end and twist"
In a pinch you can use the Allen key with it but put some aluminum foil around it and shove it in until you have enough grip to turn it
Maybe if you can grip it with pliers you can unscrew it
You need a screw extractor
Advice ð­

"You're right, that was rude of me I'm sorry Caroline"
okâ¦ anything to add to the conversation about my 2 year old nieceâ¦??? or are you going to continue to bring random commentary about the comedy community from which this chat was conceived?
"Sorry, just wanted to get that off my chest"
I can't stop thinking about how funny it is when guys like Vik Pandya promo themselves with rap music that shit cracks me up
2 year olds should be able to vote
i showed her a painting and she gasps âitâs gorgeousâ
i showed her my room and she went âoh itâs wonderful. thatâs a great room for youâ
iâm hanging out with my 2 year old niece (almost 3) and i gotta say i am sorry to everyone who has tweeted about shit their 2 year old said.
We skipped rocks together

I went to a punk show last night
@Aaron Klopfer hows japan
iâm sorry to hear that
I always think film parties are going to be really fun but they can veer towards a sort of awkwardness
Yeah thatâs sick I saw that
He made a movie with the lead of Brandon's movie that I did small part in
Jacob is at a film maker party and texted me
Ian how did u find out
I love that when you started film school the domino effect was your hog in Sundance
My weiner is in Sundance
I was thinking of jacobs
Wait oops

Wait holy shit
Whoa thatâs sick
so cool!
That is HUGE news that rules
woAAAAH
Noooooo way thatâs awesome holy shit congrats !!
"@Aaron Klinger, father of one @Bruce Kesselring apparently Brandon's movie that we were in made it to Sundance"
Iâm in here
Oh never mind I accidentally snuck into first class
Hour train ride for $5
Taking a day trip from Tokyo to a seaside town
On a train rn things really cool

but thats probs not ideal for like film stuff
i feel like the only thing people have told me is the thing we did for witches where we fill a condom and snip the top. I think its easier with actual fake blood not just like water. For dritty's dreamland i put a bunch in my like shirt pocked and smacked them really hard when i got shot and it exploded nicely????
apparently this was my last search on goodreads in 2012 (edited)
apparently this was my last search on goodreads
should i start a goodreads or do you think it would make me too much of a target
"@Aaron Klinger, father of one"
Did you officially change ur party to the 21st?
Wait bruce
That ain't me
ð
People kept telling me to do it
Who did it?
i forgot about that

smdh
Dummies
For the Gethard Show they were like âany idea you can think of our crew can make it happen! We havenât been unable to do anything yet!â And I asked for squibs and they were like âwe canât do thatâ
Just shoot someone for real
No but itâs hard to research for some reason!! Let me know if you find anything!
Does anyone have any experience making squibs
That's a really good deal
costco memberships r $20
Yeah I did it with them one time and I wanted to give real football analysis and they just wanted to screw around and talk about cum or whatever
They fully are it's wild
Feels very stupid to still be smoking out of a vape after laying eyes on this beauty. Hbd mad Dogg
Hahahahahaha
iâve showered but i still smell like truly
Wait itâs gorgeous
The thoughtful bonger
Me neither but now that I have one that has such pleasing aesthetics that would appeal to a Brooklyn based bookshelf I can bong with ease
What a beautiful smoking piece
Brings me back to the good ol days
Lol I haven't ripped a bong in a good long while
itâs BEAUTIFUL
My boyfriend got me a bong made by a graphic designer for my birthday
I do too itâs called ABCâs Lost and Iâm rewatching it
People love having something on the background while they look at their phones
Bennett streams himself watching the packers. I truly think some folks are just super lonely
I donât understand streaming but I kinda think people might tune into that
So people can watch us having fun
Every time you host something there you should put up a stream
Big hbd to maddie!!!!
Happy birthday Maddie!
Happy birthday Maddie!
Didn't get a chance to send my birthday gif
happy MADDIE DAY
I'll get a twitch stream up
Yes
so we can all know how the perg is doing at all times
Depop Perg sounds like a post modern hip-hop artist
can you share the feed
Installed cameras last night so I can keep an eye on the perg
The natural way to demo ð¥°
"10 pitbulls would be like hiring that goat-herd brush clearing service, but for demoing your house"
Thank you I WILL keep at it
Weird how her unit needed renovations ð¤
Should I put my pergola on depop?
IT GETS BETTER!!!!
Hahahahahahahaha
Fuck I should have went to the party! I didnât know thereâd be gossip like this!!!
Noâ¦..no this canât be true!!! This is insane!!!!
Thereâs apparently a woman in a temporary unit here while hers is being renovated that has 10 pit bulls in it haha
Hahaha insane behavior
i was likeâ¦. cool!
Missing Parrots right about now â¤ï¸
tbh i didnât get drunk til the end bc the first hour of the party was spent having ameerah sanders tell me she used to hate me but now she doesnâtâ¤ï¸
Not even nameable
"Damn, a bar worse than Galway Bay???"
i was out til 4 am at some bar by galway bay
INCREDIBLE!!!!
And then it coming full circle when I found out Gena and Ali were eating with her and DID eat steak
My highlight was talking to Tori and her telling me how she ended up getting chicken at a steak restaurant
"Damn, I feel like I missed part of the night"
lmao late as hell ð¤£
Just woke up ð
Last night was a movie
"Saw it, I feel like it was a reclaiming moment"
yknow what no I'm gonna maintain some dignity here
"I wouldâve been fine with that, once someone opened my car door puked, closed it, and tipped me like $30, it ruled"
Jeffrey Trent
Mitch who was the fourth guy
I was like damn maybe I couldâve learned something
"Mitchell, Noe and a white guy I donât remember had so many rules for beer pong that I regretted dropping  out of college"
And then Jonah and I played beer pong
Joey and I played beer pong
What happened at da party
Btw Iâm drunk this morning not hungover yet
In a way Iâm still there
No one knows
How late did you end up staying?
I was so full of love and Christmas spirits that I thought Iâd break into the old place in Avondale
ð
Took me all the way to Brooklyn
I also gave him Adam McShaneâs address somehow
I threw up in the Uber and tipped him $40
Happy bitthday Ms Daviss!
Joey be nice
Except @Meg I meant it
I would like to apologize to everyone who I said âyouâre so funny you should keep at itâ at the w laugh factory Christmas party last night
Was going to send âhappy birthday to the Madd Hatter!!â With a photo of Maddie in a wig and replace âhattâ with âwiggâ but Iâm not going to do that
Happy beautiful birthday to our dearest Maddie Daviss
Happy Birthday 2 Beef O Brady
Happy birthday Maddie!
mad e-birthday vibes to jellifer nawrence!
Happy birthday to the chat rocker!!
happy birthday legend!!!!
Happy birthday @Maddie Daviss
is anyone still here iâve gone non verbal in the bathroom
Just a masterclass in making an apology
I love this apology because heâs still like âthe women I was close to in my early life still suck thoughâ
thanks for the nice intentions ian!
I had every nice intention of going but it's just a lil cold and late for me I think. Plus I have to be in office tomorrow and it's my office holiday party
leaving coleâs in like 20 min if anyone wants to hop on my uberâ¤ï¸
the short list gods came thru for me
Heading to lf!
People who are there/go gotta keep us updated if anyone makes a fool of themselves
"mitchie p is, for sure"
Are people at LF?
You guys went from soy boys  to soy men
One time I got sent to the school counselor bc of being at least twelve bodies
this is at least 12 bodies
But one time I got sent to the school counselor bc I copy and pasted weird al lyrics for an essay and it seemed very violent
I know this is like an Aaron random connection
Comedians who should move to New York and/or have a baby
I didnât know two of you when that was taken and now I do so
Alright
Should we know who you guys are?
How did they go
Great pic
Cysk auditions were 5 years ago
I thought u were asking if u could do his riff on the garbage hit and runner
Oh wait nvm
an all time insane thread
https://x.com/projectkim/status/1866955330023985356?s=42
I guess I'll rage
Fine
Whatever
the party probably is just starting around 10ish
no girl itâs the other way around
Just kidding I donât need credit I love stuff like this
Wait is everyone going late?
Not at all!! Just give me credit if it hits and donât mention me if it bombs
Might go to LF early so I can go to Cole's
I'm gonna try this at Cole's lol
You care if I do this on stage Richie?
Unless people so choose that is
would LOVE for people to come hang
Also would anyone want to meet at Coleâs to pregame LF  in like an hour? NOT to go up Kristi dw just to hang
what time are folks going to LF
ð
That was by accident but I think the sentiment stands
ð
Do NOT send me the fb invite
What time are people going to LF
Be there soon
nobody go to coleâs tn thank u
I'm going
oh frick i donât think i can. make meaningful lifelong connections for me!
iâm like ðð letâs hang out with some of the randomest people in the nation all together
whoâs going to LF party
girl i guess
we the intelligentsia were exchanging ideas
iâm back
omg it works
hello
why canât i go on instagram and messenger
whatâs going on
That's really smart to have thought to done that
yeah i came up with remembering this just now
That's a really beautiful poem ð¢
Did u just come up with that
"I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I, turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I, to be blind pretending not to see their needs?

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could've been any clearer
If they wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream (washed out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)
And no message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh)
I'm asking him to change his ways (oh)
And no message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place)
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)

(You gotta get it right, while you got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart) you can't
(Then you close your) close your, your mind
With the man in the mirror, oh yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways (better change)
No message could've been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

(Oh yeah) gonna feel real good now

I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Come on (change)
Just lift yourself
You know
You've got to stop it
Yourself (yeah)

(Make that change)
I've got to make that change today
(Man in the mirror) you got to
You got to not let yourself brother
(Yeah) you know
(Make that change) I've got to get that man, that man

You've got to
You've got to move
Come on
Come on
You got to
Stand up, stand up (yeah, make that change)
Stand up

Stand up and lift
Yourself, now
(Man in the mirror)

(Yeah, make that change)
Gonna make that change come on
(Man in the mirror)

You know it
You know it
You know it
You know
Change
Make that change"
yeah to that iâll say
And insulted you'd say it is
Not the same
"Sorry, it's not."
yeah iâve been running in shorts and figure itâs similar
It's pretty nice
I've been doing cold plunges on my legs after skateboarding
Ooof
i have not and i canât believe i ever did that. it was so cold
That may be the difference here
Have you been keeping up on cold plunging?
i donât think luigi should have yelled at the media but iâm no vigilante
my close personal friend avatara
is instagram down
Just leave behind a Drive Damage Depart sticker
But I could hit-and-run a CEOs car
I'm not quite hardcore enough to do the full Luigi
The hit and runner's manifesto
"Drive
Damage
Depart"
"Damage
Dump
Demolish"
I can't believe they'd put in this much planning just to take out your means of transportation
"This is like when Luigi Mangione shot that CEO, but it's a city worker and your car"
It's nice you got the note
Is ur car drive able
Idk but people left a note with a plate number
Are u gonna be compensated
How did u find out
Damn that sucks man
A sanitation truck hit my parked car
This is really really funny
it was obv tasty but the best thing was watching all the like Bridgeport lifer groundskeeping old dudes be like âwhat da hell is this? I donât know about soup you eat with chopsticksâ¦â
it was soo sick
the only thing getting me through the day is that they had a pho bar at the white sox employee cafeteria
In light of recent events I will now always be coated in a layer of our experimental bulletproof lotion for men
"it was more like ""so crazy that Luigi did that. I actually know his family"""
no his family is like prominent in Baltimore
I'm actually cool if you get me
I'm not like other ceos
Is he trying to be like a pick me ceo
Yeah what was his take or perspective?
I bet he was like at the same country club party as them
the ceo is from Maryland so is probably just bragging about proximity to wealth
I would instantly stop liking him if I knew he bought from this company
Do you guys sell trigger finger lotion
Look him up in the system and see if he bought anything
Canât believe messenger is out when I just heard the tiege ceo say that he knew Luigiâs parents
Kingdom Come: Deliverance
Lemme boot it up right now and check
I feel like Iâd love that
Which game
And play my game about being a medieval peasant
Just wanna chill
I'm struggling to work these past few days
Office vibes are particularly bleak today
weird phone who dis
yeah one sec my phone is weird
Did you also send the response?
I don't know that it is
is it not sending
"""I know we have a long history, and the kids miss you, but I'm featuring you in a piece I'm writing for the New Yorker."""
like i sucked ur thumb for two hours one night ago threee years ago dont talk to me like im ur ex wife
ok but donât u hate this response
hahaHAHAHA
Thatâs much better than him asking about the ass cookies
Oh lol
however it is all about the tramp stamp show promo
so i assumed it was my latest reel
oh wait yeah forgot to update its not the reel its roadkill show poster actually i was scared to open it at first
Yeah weird! If it was a listicle or something itâd make sense if he wanted a quote or something to add to it but
"i asked him what hes writing about and he said a column on organic promo that hes ""sending to many industry people"" and then sent "" ur welcome xx"""
i think its weird that he wasnt like hey im thinking about writing about u for this what do u think
hes a social media analyst thats not the weird part to me
Why would he need the insights
To ask for food in want I make the animal noises ð¯ðµ
"""featuring it for an article"""
Lmfao
ask if iâm ok w that first? hahahaha
does he have to like
"that stamptown brother i hooked up w three years ago just randomly DMd me âcan i have the insights for ur latest reel, featuring it on an articleâ"
I hear if you die in Japan you die in real life
Yeah I guess
That would probably happen here too honestly
A guy mean mugged me bc I showed his girl shrek
At a club in Japan and kept showing girls pictures of shrek
I would honestly love to see the vibe
"Damn, true!"
Isnât that better than work??
"But consider this: you get to pay $5 to watch other people who think paying $5 for an open mic is a good idea, and you canât leave"
4pm on a Wednesday is a horrible time
"And I canât, I work normal hours"
I know the host!
Fear City indeed
you couldn't design a worse open mic
-arbitrary threats of banning
"-no list, chosen at random"
-being punished for showing any time before 3:55
-Pay to go up
-4PM
I'll venmo you $5 to go to this
you need to go for me
What schizophrenic posted this?
You can tell all of NYâs best comics go to this mic
Iâve walked by it and been bummed out just by the vibe from outside
This place seems awesome
"Also sorry, but being banned from Fear City comedy club is like being banned from Kansas. I wasnât going anyways"
I think itâs cool to pay for something and get banned for having to leave a bit early
Idk I think itâs about time that somebody made open mics feel like a bad time
Hellish vibe!
Getting Christmas cards ready
I liked it!
Thinking about defending my polycueâs honor
Pretty good!
Any you seen Black Doves on Netflix
genuinely amazing post
Who's he talking about?
On my insta story
JFL Vancouver haha reacted to how I said I was flicking the bean to their poster
YES!!
what doesnât he know that we do
what does he know that we donât
I canât wait for a waiter to get fired over this
i watched english teacher the other nightâ carmen was very how you would expect!
carmen christopher randomly looking at my tiktok
Actually Jonah is admin
Yea please!
Do you need an add to the non-jewish group chat?
Iâm straight and Christian now
You guys
"Awww, I was gonna premiere my Dump Humper joke"
i donât want to be there
actually yeah pls donât come tomorrow
bc victoria asked me to be last shift hahaha
but i wonât be mad if nobody shows up so my night can end early
I hope youâre first shift â¤ï¸
yes
Is Coleâs gonna happen tomorrow?
I love that you guys can track when I take my adderall
I put this up and wanna get back into it
Anyone wanna collab on making stuff like this around town
last year willie griswold asked me if i was doing ok and i told him to mind his business
i got black out drunk last year
When's the johnmedy holiday party
Now
Everyone should have an invite
They keep forgetting to book me too
Crazy how they somehow forgot all of us?
Me too in addition as well pls
Absolutely
can you do the same for me
Just sent it to you
Is there an FB event for the LF party? I feel like there usually is one
Love it
Mitch lowkey a sassy brat
I'm gonna ask 14 comics who I've never spoken to if they want to produce a lodge show with me
I'm gonna tell everyone they were snubbed by the gazellies this year
Itâs incredible
People who do two mics a year walk up to you and just say âIâm doing some networking with you right nowâ
It's one of the rare times all of my favorite people and all of my least favorite people are in the same room
I canât wait
Itâs the best people watching day of the year
I'm gonna tell Katie Zane to keep at it
I thought it was usually thursdays but I'm gonna go and get so drunk that I tell Chicago's worst comedians that I love them
It seems feral
Whatâs the vibe of it
No tomorrow
wait is the LF party tonight?
no I'm asking
I feel like they usually cancel it the week of the holiday party
"Oh yeah, maybe the mic is off?"
LF holiday party is this week?
Just in case
Bring your packet
Mostly a place to network for laughable news
Go with the expectation you will not be performing
Tough to get on
"Yeah, it's fun"
Has anyone done the laugh factory mic before
No
Nvm
Is In lieu of gi anything
"Thereâs a guy here who keeps saying he looks like Luigi and itâs likeâ¦buddy, you look nothing like him"
I want the whole chat to go
If you guys donât go to Japan Iâm gonna be so mad
I keep meeting Israelis who are hot :(
new years resolution is to write more manifestos
everyone maintain joint mobility please ð literally move your joints to keep em healthy especially your back
honestly the biggest takeaway iâve learned so far is to never get back surgery
the 5th grader i tutored had experience in this assassin game
"https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto

Manifesto dropped"

"currently writing about how there is so much merch for Luigi because of the rise of print on demand. Its so funny that every etsy seller selling ""deny, defend, depose"" tshirts also has MAGA shirts and pride shirts for sale in there shops"
https://shatterzone.substack.com/p/alleged-ceo-shooter-luigi-mangione
If you want a good take perchance
I concerned people are going to start slapping standups!!
I feel like so many journalists are disconnected from reality
do something ð«¶
Iâm just obsessed with the fact that the guy was a lindy man/paul skallas head
Waiting on the steakums x account to weigh in
But no company or brand is going to be like âwe agree with the internet! Itâs good that the ceo was killed!l
"Yeah so many people see it as the senseless taking of a life like any other murder, instead of a targeted attack of the head of a company that sent a message that desperately needed to be sent"
Nooooooooo
"Oh nooooo, shooters are going start trying to shoot rich, powerful, politically polarizing people????"
Because then every loser will want to be him instead of shooting innocent people at a mall
Thatâs why itâs cool that heâs hot and impressive
Targeted killings in
Mass shootings out
smdh
dont love the 4chanification of john stockwell
smdh
Next you're gonna ask what skibidi toilet is
Just sit in your apartment looking at the wall
Jesus Christ what do you do all day
"blaming everything i dont like on the ""4chanification"""
I guess these people will throw any garbage take against the wall tho instead of giving any sort of weight to the fact that an overwhelming majority of people like that this guy did that
"""this is just as bad as when incels celebrate school shootings!!!"""
The 4chanification
Lol what a stupid take
https://www.wired.com/story/the-internet-is-gripped-by-mangione-mania/
worst take alert
He excelled in evading the police after evading the goose in duck duck go
"Or like 

He did a mob hit, and we learned that him and his friends were a group that regularly role played as mob members. 

In the card game, Mafia,"
"Basically the equivalent of being like 

This murderer who killed a plumber has some experience with this because in college he played Mario video games"
Can someone explain to a non-gamer what this means
The humble comedian
Humble
I think some studios are selling cool art but I will just simply have photos of my friends doing plays and a bunch of beers
Spreading this invite far and wide cuz I think it will be very fun and also I owe everyone a beer for making you listen to my UHC shooter conspiracy theory https://partiful.com/e/O9LkYGZaNK6qLNJMrHdu
ð
âFeeling cool ðâ
Opportunity to have a cool roommate
idk why they would make up something like thaty
yeah don't be scared of that
I don't think that's true
someone said this means thereâs a waluigi working in private equity somewhere
Free Luigi
Damn
Like what the fuck
I'm diving deep into this luigi stuff man

Getting paid to poop is one of the small pleasures of working. And nobody will question it because itâs embarrassing for them
Any relation to the satire writer Nate Odenkirk?
itâs been 20 min and they gotttaaa be wondering where i am but i do t wanna text my manager that im pooooping in a major way
stuck on the toilet at work itâs hell on earth
The perfect spot to reflect
heâs repped by naomi odenkirk!
"Which is maybe why he was just hanging in a McDonalds, I mean"
"I think this is 100% right, I was thinking about how America is so accustomed to senseless violence that when there is a logic or sense to what someone did there is a immediate sympathy and kind of assuming he's a genius. But he can be both kinda smart and also kinda manic and not thinking through what would happen afterwards"
lol
Jake Prizant is in a Potbelly ad?
but i do magnesium and ashwagunda and cortisol reducers
ok not to out myself as a hippie
I use a drug called marijuana (spelling?) when I'm anxious
Not a book and maybe unhelpful but I know people who have taken magnesium pills to help with anxiety symptoms
I've heard those are good idk my brain is fine
"The worry trick, the untethered soul, the art of letting go"
I have it in my hotel room Iâll try to find it
Teaches you to be your friend along da way
Oh um I think this self compassion book goes hard
Quran
How to gain friends and win influence
"Sorry chat, but does anyone have any book recs for dealing with anxiety? I've got some goals I'm trying to achieve that are definitely not related to recent news events"
Also new sick jacket for cheap
Some Russians did a photoshoot with me
"Now that the dust has settled a little bit from today, it needs to be appreciated how fucking funny it is that William Banksâs big project that heâs been working on for *months* was launched on the day of the biggest arrest and jailing in recent history"
I also believe he had a lot of actual material
I love what Ryan's doing onstage and am laughing with not at him ftr
It kind of intersects with laughing at him
it also would have been a 2 hour and 30 min show but mike robinson dropped
"Like, you can give him the phone book, and it would be fun to watch him read it"
"Like, they don't make jokes, they just ARE and it's funny to watch"
ryan did so bad that grace called kiehron in to drop in after his set
That's the category of comic he falls into. I've seen them before
I was real stoked to see you did Rib tips at lf
not only was it two hours long but it was 2 hours and fifteen minutes
Also how was your 30?
Wait can you confirm that this show is 2 hours long
im genuinely confused if people are making fun of him or like him
What if she had her period halfway through
I donât think a woman could do that set
IDK!!!
i feel like if a girl did that set they simply wouldnât book her
Poor kid
But I also get how he could bomb for 30 minutes straight lol
"Yeah, he's one of those people whose jokes aren't for anyone? idk how to describe it. I like seeing him on stage"
Hahahahahahahahahaha
I'm all in on Ryan
He crushed for 65 minutes straight at his laugh factory show
it was silent for 30 min
he followed me at headliners
Where are you watching Ryan do 30 mins?
Does anyone emotionally connect to this hat
One day he's gonna be a 40 year old man who acts like that
This is his past life
Heâs not meant for this timeline
"He is supposed to be a 1930âs dustbowl vagrant working for beans from farm to farm, train to train"
i just donât get whatâs real iâm confused
iâm like is he trying to do like joe pera core
He donât seem like a tantrum guy
Unless theyâre throwing a tantrum
No one really bombs on purpose
Idk man
I think he thinks they just donât get it
heâs walked five people so far heâs half way thru his half hour
or is he just binning
is ryan oliver going for like bombing
ok iâm confused
Bought this bad boy
and then we can decide the pope of the chat
When you see it weâll add you to conclave chat
I saw it as well! (With @Adrienne Stout)
i loved it!
@Adrienne Stout saw it!
Might fuck around and hit up a matinee tomorrow
Hate to distract from the assassin talk but has anyone in the chat seen conclave
Wonder if Luigi and William Banks are in the same jail
iâve heard of a haircut but thatâs ridiculous
Dude paid attention to literally each strand of hair
conspiracy twitter discovering the concept of a scatterbrained genius
Knows his angles
Gotta hit the gym and work on my assassin bod
he sounds like an esfj
Murder for a cause is so sigma
Heâd be a hero to everyone
I feel like inmates would love him
the fact is that he was a meatball but the question is was he neurospicy. weâll have to wait to see the court evidence
I want a John wick quiet gun
And no one catch him
It would have been so sick for CEOâs to live in permanent fear
I saw a video of someone using the same gun setup and it's literally silent. It's just clicking noises lol that insane that that's legal
Eating a cheeseburger was actually the activation action for my and hundreds of other sleeper cell ivy league school Andrew huberman trained assassins
Italian intuition
The silencer and the weird bullets
;)
he should have gotten time and a half to prepare
I'm just so curious how he got that insane load out
Very Italian to lower your mask to flirt
Maybe he had sensory sensitivities and had to let the skin breathe
a slightly impulsive meatball
i guess itâs a trade off between looking normal and being camouflaged but seems very not smart to have been bare faced on surveillance
If he wore a prosthetic  face I think he wouldâve gotten away with it
united healthcare is so bad
Bro
ð¤
E-girl hiding in cakes
People are gonna break into jail to fuck him
lol
iâm gagged
iâm sorry but the girl i had every class at depaul with making it in this post
Hot guy name I guess!
Can I just add a random Italian as a placeholder
Oh nvm
Would we be on a watchlist if I add him to the chat
all his socials are deleted now
His was different somehow
We must've not been smoking the same weed
Heâs just like every dude I smoked weed with in college for real
That's all Trump does about healthcare lol
Goddamn
It would be such a wild card if Trump pardoned him
Michell Potts Pardon Power 2025
Not if I have anything to say about it
"Damn, imagine if the trump shooter lived to hear himself get compared to this chad"
He'll see it in 2060
Just the word ârespectâ
Joe has DMâd him
They don't have the chops
Are we competing with Joe Eames chat?
"So this is how brat summer ends. Not with a whimper, but a bang."
I only just got around to following him on IG and let me tell ya: we are not the only group chat thirsting after our boy Luigi
"I know heâs probably dealing with a lot, but I do wonder if part of him is like âmy boys chat is going off right nowâ"
"adding ""Kill Bluecross CEO"" to my goals"
going over my self evaluation for the year
UHG killer was ted cruz
the moment it dawns on us
one of my fav days in the chat thus far
chat today
william banks
source?!!!?
Gotta add him to the chat
confirmed bisexual
wait heâs bi
I wish we could add him to the chat
Heâs one of charliâs angels ð¼
If he'd finished level 5 those bullets would have said zip zap zop
Representation is so important
Somebody on Twitter confirmed that heâs taken at least one improv class
Heâs so foine
wish i could DM her lol
That is absolutely wild
Oh my god
i had like every depaul class w the girl in this pic
a girl i went to depaul with is his friend
going back to the assassin
Go off
this day is a rollercoaster
god i have more gossip
Canât stop watching sister wives today
its absolute reddit humor
Heâs already got a guy throwing gang signs
"Like, the idea of the bit is funny but I feel like heâs going to hit some pretty rough stereotypes"
Like itâs an annoying movement but even lamer to not get that itâs a joke as a comic
"Thereâs a comic at that laugh factory that has a bit about this but she doesnât understand itâs a joke, so she just looks silly"
It feels like when Elon Musk references Dogecoin
It's really lame
Or he shouldve filmed his court trial and found out that the judge has a car world tattoo
itâs been fun playing journalist i cannot lie
Iâm going to New York this weekend and Iâm going to free him from his bit
he just needs to post this
Itâs very easy actually to end the bit without âgoing backâ which is just be like âthey released me from prison early due to good behaviorâ
"clare austen smith , bianca, ian lockwood"
few sources
iâve gone too far i canât go back
like literally so âis a hotdog a sandwich-coreâ
and he is like
i guess one of his friends talked to him and was like u can really stop this u know
Who is your source or is it confidential
Thatâs awesome and will go over well
I cannot stand the birds arenât real thing
heâs gonna release videos this week of him being beat up by actors in his fake jail
god i have even more info
The alt comedy dark web
That's pretty crazy
Whoa....
and itâs all being paid for by the Birds Arenât Real guy
so he rented out an old jail
i got more william info
Biden has the opportunity to do the funniest pardon of all time
i fucking love him
heâs soooo funny
He linked his google plus account really wish I could get in there
planning his signature look perhaps
love that the only thing he pinned was a hoodie
mein craft
Memes
ð

Iâd say it isnât entirely devoid of racism
The sausage was rlly good too but I think I was expecting something else
The spring rolls went crazy
Damn how were the sausage and spring rolls
We are instagram friends now
That's the plate
Good rec Ty
That's it
Oh Ian I went to Thailand restaurant yesterday
Found his Pinterest
https://www.pinterest.com/lnmangione/
Japan tv rocks
This is good stuff
Maybe God is real
seems like everyone is mad at him and eric yates is defending him
LITERALLY
"I will say that since the prison thing is a bit, I have to wonder what kind of thought process went into hiring those two guys for the pictures lol"
In mine craft parody etc
Why can't we do the same with alt comedians
The FBI does it with mentally ill people all the time
Honestly we should be enabling William Banks to be the next Mangione
this is also happening
while this is happening
"Expecting Tinder bios to say âsorry, must be taller than me and willing to murder capitalist pigsâ"
Sentiment remains
I saw it lol
First unsend â¤ï¸
"Sorry dude, hot people are on top again"
Hot people need to stay in their lane
Do we know how tall he is yet
I think it's bullshit he's hot ngl
Did you pay?
Hahaha did not know about this
what if the guy who killed Unitedhealthcare ceo was a guy who venmo requested me 2.75 for a 7/11 slurped
It's the confidence
Proof hot people are superior
Iâd do a 180 on Nate in an instant
itâs actually famous nepo baby nate odenkirk
oh fuck they just released itâs not him now
Human resources meme irl
And then the guy who tried to get trump and failed was some fugly loser
It's funny that the successful universally loved assassination was perpetrated by a hot guy
Let him host!!! ððð
i fucking love him
"Damn, he's chill"
Hahahahahahahaha
Put your degree to good use
Kill lorne Michaels
Try and kill someone
asssassins dad wrote for snl
You should catch up
industry plant like bobbi althoff
This is like that but if the Boston marathon were evil
Remember when the Boston marathon bombed was hot
relax heâs a one hit wonder
Wanna feel old? Luigi Mangione was only 26 when he killed Brian Thompson
i canât even get a sales job
wait heâs literally my age
Heâs a nepo baby
Omg I just found out this guys dad is Mark David Chapman
Uh yeah Iâd be assassinating ceos too if my parents paid my rent!
"And thus, entrepreneur in bio"
People romanticize the working class but those guys are all busy watching Sunday night football. You need some ambition to take out a ceo
"Yeah, to me!"
He has the jawline
Well heâs âperson of interestâ
And maybe we just found a hot Italian guy who loves the Unibomber
wait really
Hey thereâs still a chance this isnât the guy
god heâs sooooooo hot
ok i caught the insta before it started popping letâs see how many followers he gets
lmao his insta
Iâm so bummed NYPD seemed truly too stupid to fine him
And I love that he's a private school ivy League guy. elitism in a good way
Iâd be so embarrassed if I was assassinated by an uggo
So sick that itâs a hot guy
Hahahahaha
Does anyone have any good screenshots for when Shankland does something like this
should I connect?
i dated him
Oh we're about to hear from anyone who dated him in high school
It's funny that like when more or this stuff happens we're gonna be seeing what they posted on linkedin and letterbox
On that Sacco and Venzetti shit
He makes some good points that I was just about to make
Hell yeah I knew we could count on the Italians
thatâs a spicy meatball

Luigi Mario?
He's the suspected guy?
I wonder if they will publish the manifesto
And is going to draw a lot of attention
I'm honestly happy it's a guy with a statement and anti health insurance
Luigi M has a pretty solid Goodreads page
It worked on me. I'm about to go hit that dislike button as fast as I can.
Like who's reading that and going damn ok!
Do u think that message has worked on anyone?
"""Chicago's biggest names in production"""
That's so funny
Hahahahahahahahaha
"I know, this is huge"
Should be fine imo
I am not sure it could go either way
should i run coleâs on new yearâs day or is that a disaster idea
Is this real

i forget who it was but it was some instagram medium. she encouraged us to network with each other and cultivate our intuition so i tried to schedule a call with another girl but she kept rescheduling and then i got a software job.

poop fucker is the best thing to happen to this chat for a while
They like boomer dad humor sry
Iâm getting along well with folks

I feel this is off-brand for you
she is literally my favorite person
Let Trisha Paytas host!!! ððð
i never asked them if they thought he was hot or not....
i asked my parents what they thought of snl last night & they both went on & on about how they dont think paul mescal is hot
This is giving me brain worms
I was on fb marketplace
"Theyâre pretty chill though, you should be good!"
They might give a little stink but only because they sell coffee there
Will music box let me bring a coffee in?

The kid is still in the class today?
And you're basically the CEO of the classroom
I would say that but they're probably gonna be all hopped up on that UnitedHealth CEO thing
You should hit the toughest kid first so they know that youâre the boss
You have kid puncher class?
I've got that class after lunch wish me luck

Hell are they hiring??
Could be worse!
And itâs closer to my apartment than when I worked in midtown and I work only 9-5 as opposed to 8-6 like I did
That's the spirit
Gonna be honest? Easiest job Iâve ever had though
Hey Sam this job sounds like it sucks!
And everyone was very chill about it
"Today, there was a woman who barricaded herself and someone else in their apartment and was like making threats and cops got called and ALSO in another building, a guy got shot and killed"
Still fine I think
but also the person in contact is the recruiter not the girl who interviewed me

I thought it was about if a police officer a native American a sailor and a construction worker got gym memberships
Likeâ¦thereâs no way to not come off as homophobic with  that
Itâs a pretty incredible thing to sue someone about
"The quote is âitâs about black guys hanging out, thereâs nothing gay about thatâ"
I just read an article about how the guy from the village people who wrote ymca is going to start suing news networks for calling it a gay anthem
That's a big leaders who lead opportunity
You also have the opportunity to be the first person who likes this

you used to be able to smoke on the plane! people dressed up!
I mean itâs sooo annoying to fly now!
Thatâs the world I wanna live in
Imagine killing the ceo of your airline cuz your flight got delayed
Right but thatâs a manufacturer
well u really want the boeing ceos to be found in a ditch
Iâm less hardline about airline ceos but I did learn yesterday that ultimately Iâm fine with them getting killed too
gonna watch the joker tn
When I realized it was the healthcare company I was immediately like oh yeah well he should die
I thought it was the other United though so I was confused
I was on a date last night and she really didnât like how glad I was that the guy was murdered
Theyâre stoked!
wait i thought everyone was lowkey excited
* watching someone get murdered * Iâll have what heâs having
"Yeah, only if after we get murdered we go to Katz!"
*bleeding out in the street* only in New York
"Bro Iâll be in New York next week letâs do the legendary hang of Starbucks, photo op, getting murdered"
This city never sleeps! Manhattan is always a party
"What if the bullets said ""pussy, money, weed"""
I was like damn thats hardcore but if that's what we're doing I'm onboard
I only skimmed the headline yesterday and thought everyone was real excited about the ceo of united airlines getting killed
If you're going to pull something crazy like this you'd be stupid not do do something like that
Somebody posted this in the Simpsonâs Reddit and itâs perfect
It's like ok one guy getting killed in the street like a dog is sad in itself but don't ask me to mourn for him any harder than the literal millions of people who have suffered and died far worse deaths due to the (very profitable) choices made by people like this guy
kinda wild heâs still at large
I saw this really good quote from Mark twain that I think sums up how many people are feeling about this incident
Also he was wearing a camera backpack lol
Thatâs why in the video heâs constantly pulling the back of the gun
"The gun didnât jam, heâs using subsonic rounds that donât automatically eject so he has to eject them by hand, the subsonic rounds with the silencer made it much much quieter"
Also whatâs crazy
Some riddler ass shit
Also whatâs crazy about the assassin he left bullets that had written on them words like âdefendâ âdenyâ âdeposeâ
I saw them
They flirted at a party
mf not getting caught
She's a long time supporter of laughable news
Hahahahaha
i'm going to have a convo with her
why does my younger sister follow brian roe
"Yeah there were some stories of there saying he got away on a citi bike but now they're saying that didn't happen, nor sure what to believe in regards to that but he is still at large"
I think it's safe to say he knows someone who died or greatly suffered from the company fucking up their life because pretty much all of us know someone that's happened to
and he was just on a bike
I'm going to go out on a limb and say there was intent
"It's united Healthcare, they are notable for denying claims at a higher rate than other companies"
brian roe is a babe
like with intention or just random
wooooah
In da big apple
wait it was on a lime scooter but for bikes
A guy just walked up to a CEO of a major health care company and fucking smoked him
was he a bad guy
why did he get got
He was being too good at being a ceo
wait ok still havenât checked my phone in a major way  did a ceo get assassinated
Jesus fucking christ lol
Good song for the daft punk type fans tbh
This slaps
Hold on

My top track this year"
I think a lot of CEOs have gone in and out of court for anti trust or insider trading stuff. My impression is that it's sort of normal honestly
Too cold inside
Where are folks tonight?
Lmao that's a pretty good Photoshop
@Deborah Johnigan Protector any update from Deb??
Lmaoooooo get his ass
Am I seeing double?!?!?!?!
Easy choice
And unearned confidence
Bro has an ugly soul
Honestly so funny that women think he is hot until he starts speaking
Lol so many people have his face shape
Yes they have the same face shape
Anybody else get Brian roe vibes from Nick on love is blind
Jolly bean's burner account
Constructive criticism stings the most
"(I apologized, getting a hang of key phrases)"
"A museum worker approached me and some reason 
my first thought was my ween shirt was too casual for the imperial palace, it was for chewing gum"
I'm gonna submit a packet to laughable news
They were able to see straight thru all the production and jokes
Lol yeah it's crazy that Brian wasn't able to pull a fast one over on randos
know*
"Damn, even the randoms think it's bad"
Damn
He's gonna have to put the stream up early or he might crash the servers
Laughable News tomorrow is going to be ELECTRIC
The laughable news
Oh gosh
Canât wait for Brian Roeâs take on this whole thing
Hahahahahaha
Got smoked twice today
Damn he got smoked
13.5k laugh reacts
You do I'm just being a radical extremist
We all know the hierarchy goes this one health care CEO and then landlords are next
I feel like I make a good case ð¥º
And besides
You just have bad opinions
No of course nto
THE BIRTHDAY CURSE HAS NO EFFECT ON MY OPINIONS
He's the most establishment person in the group chat
I think they have camera footage of it
Well we should also take everything John says with a grain of salt
how do they know it was a citi bike and not just like his own electric bike
A high tourist and commuter area? Wherever he leaves that e-Citi bike it's getting used by someone else within the next 30 minutes
"Think about it, too"
There are def ways to get an electric citi bike and not have the account or card you're using traced back to you
"The options are 
1. On foot
2. Bike
3. Motorcycle?"
"Also, I feel like getting away on an electric Citi bike is the play in Manhattan, you can't drive a car down there, and anything else is public transit"
Really straight forward
"99% of the time, to unjam a gun, you basically just cock the gun again"
"Sincerely, not hard"
"Climate Conscious, healthcare defending king ð"
830
changed the location to rainbo club
iâve been running around looking for balloons
wait what was there a shooting
But of course they mispronounced it ð¤¦ #fml #NowWe'llNeverKnow
I just saw the clip where the Starbucks workers are trying to read the name written on the killers gun before they hand it off to him
"I just found a clip where you can hear the audio and the shooter goes âsir, will you sign my gun? Oh no! Itâs slipping out of my handsâ and then the gun goes off and he goes ânoooo I didnât mean to kill you!!!â"
Idk maybe more people will ruminate on stuff like this
It's like u got the shinzo abe guy and then this one
And idk maybe nothing will happen but if they don't find the killer or dif up more info
Well even if there was a conspiracy/something to cover up shareholders I think most people will probably buy that this was a frustrated citizen caught up in grievances
The citizens of kms avenue are hanging on by a thread
You guys please do not solve this. I need this
But at the end of the day I think it was just all a big misunderstanding that was actually also an accident
Citi bike thing is a good point that seems v trackable
no pressure i know thereâs this thing called coleâs tn
but probs 9pm bar time
time TBD weâre going to ahkoshi by mustache so weâre about to see how long weâre waiting
"""Yo what's up guys welcome to how to kill a CEO in broad daylight today's video is brought to you by DRAFTKINGS sportsbook"""
Tell him Happy birthday day from me
and iâm gonna surprise him at best intentions after dinner with pals
Yooo
itâs my boyfriends bday
but at the end of the day
wait sorry i know weâre in a big convo
I feel like based on these new conspiracy things arising this will be quickly memory-holed like the airline whistle-blower they killed
"But if I was shooting someone and my gun jammed I would look up how to unjam a gun youtube, skim through it, get to the part where they do it and watch it a couple times"
Also I donât know anything about guns
And you go to thailand and heâs drinking at the end of the bar
It would be wild if they never did
Itâs assumed that they will find him
He was buying the Starbucks New York mugs
Sorry if that's a dumb  question I don't want to learn things about NYC
Also are Citi Bikes not linked to your phone? Shouldn't they have like all of the guy's information?
I bet he got one of those Stanley cups and was killed for it ð
We donât know
Thatâs the thing
What was his order
ð£ï¸ ð£ï¸ ð£ï¸
Yeah either way we win
CEOs should be scared to be in public ð
But I really want to believe itâs a vigilante
No im getting to the bottom of this
But this is one where I kind of hope we just never know
Hell fucking yeah
I totally agree with you Matty
It feels more like a âweâre worried this guy is gonna flip mob style hitâ
Yeah I had no idea about the Starbucks camera but thatâs really interesting
Yea now youâre with me Mitchell
Yes!!!!!!! Thatâs what Iâm saying. It doesnât line up that he is on Starbucks cameras also????
I think someone not trained wouldâve panicked when the gun jammed
The assassin really seemed to know what they were doing
Cuz itâs like hell yeah
I want it to be angry guy for sure
No totallyyyyy
So I actually think the conspiracy angle is more likely but I find it more inspirational to believe it is a guy who had a claim denied
I think United healthcare is trying to make it seem like itâs an angry person who like had a claim denied
He rides one of the most trackable modes of transportation??????????
Idk like they have pics of him in a Starbucks??? This guy just wanted to be seen
Yeah it feels crazy they didnât catch him immediately
"In summary: insider trading, all the stuff about him being in a Starbucks right before the shooting and getting his photo taken and riding a Citibike????"
Alright fine Iâll listen to your podcast
It is well known that Joey has CIA ties
Hahahaha
Iâm sending a voice memo
Go on
I saw he was getting investigated for insider training
I had to write about it for work and I think it was an inside job sorry I really do
Wait guys I think it was a conspiracy
I just hope we don't see like record speed from congress passing legislation adding extra rights and protection to ceos
If we want any change we gotta get John hinkley jr off his meds
Io
^ example of something I would say if I was a crazy guy and not an honest citizen who would never wish harm on someone I love my government
Truly this needs to happen more!! These people need to be terrified to walk on the streets
Good fun violence works too
It may be! This could be huge!
King shit
Love that he biked away
"If this guy drops a merch store, you know Iâll be buying"
Sometimes violence IS the answer
My company had been BCBS for years and just switched to united for 2025
*gun
It's just nice to see that we are getting some good fun violence over here for once
Ya don't know if there's any hot takes on something that most people universally like or appreciate
goes without saying we approve
Checking in after a long day and honestly? Thought the chat was gonna have more hot takes on the united ceo
it probably is bc it says he works at stand-up comedian!! ð¤©
thats a name i recognize
was it david louis?
Mallory Bradford?
tina fey
Or Lewis?
David something?
A friend is asking who hosted the second city open mic in 2018?
Sold out I think idk this shit is goofy
Oh shit but they wear masks for this
Maybe tonight Iâll do music
I think Iâm gonna stick to the boxing
I wonder if wrestling would be more fun tho
My favorite anime has boxing tournaments here
It lacks awareness lol
"Lmao, I know, and I don't understand it either. I know cartoonists make like ""distinctive"" choices in their drawing style to distinguish their work from other artists? But this dude is kind of completely ripping off South Park in every other way"
I know you mean racist people but it really looks like youâre agreeing with a point heâs making
Why do all of their chins look like that
And a little bit Kamala Harris
"Sorry, it just seems to be Lawrence Fishburn"
He does the voice of every black person with an egregious blaccent
"every video this guy makes, he tags #adultswim lmao"
something I ALSO kindof really want
they have Gutfeld swag!!!!
It devastated me
My mom told me on thanksgiving that sheâs a big Greg Gutfeld fan
"""jokes"" is a strong word for it"
He's literally just ripping off South Park and making conservative oriented jokes
In Japan right now btw
I think it's because I was looking at the fox news shop maybe?
https://www.tiktok.com/@albarrycomedy?_t=8rwhY0BsaVD&_r=1
Even better!
"Also, here's something fun to hate watch that I just found"
Just get it as is
HAHAHAHAHA
This one is great because you can pretend that youâre a host
That is some unregulated emotional fuckery tho lol
Met her at my job and forever like her
I love her still tbh

"yeah, just steal the design"
get a cease and desist
Make your own
"god, I kinda want some fox merch, but I don't wanna support fox news"
"oh man, I'm gonna make a video about this"
I THINK YOU MEAN CHRISTMAS

Aaron set his own nickname to the eastern mule.
Thought this would get some engagement in here
They didnât care in the slightest about anything
(This is very stupid and unnecessary)
Aaron set his own nickname to the drug mule of the east.
I successfully snuck in my ADHD meds by putting them inside other pills
Sucks I wasnât trusted enough
I wish I got the dm
which felt like type casting but whatever

Sorry I'm fucking stupid
Steven Springer
Do I gotta spell it out

Does anyone remember when the old guy was booked on fresh faces
No petition but Kristi definitely got a dm from her
And did anyone save it or screen cap it somewhere
Does anyone remember when Joe eames girlfriend made a petition to get gena kicked out of lodge because she was flirting with Joe
I have another project for the chat
Well I've gotta go to work now
Iâm down for a road trip
I kinda feel like I've done all I can do at this point short of driving it straight to her door
Yes
Was this her email? dajohnigan@cookcountycourt.com
"Audrey is asking her friend if she knows her, itâd be funny if it was Hannah"
Mary texted her friend Hannah who literally knows Audrey lol I think they work together
I returned it to his social worker to get it back to him
Circuit Court is what Audrey says
One time I found this teens wallet and he was homeless :(
Yeah
Yeah civil dept
Also you could probably bring it to the county building??
I just texted Audrey Jonas because she works for the county too and Iâm like maybe thatâs her department
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer set the nickname for Anthony Siraguse to Deborah Johnigan Protector.
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer set the nickname for Anthony Siraguse to Debra Johnigan Protector.
And her little picture looks like a sweet old grandma
I mean this ladies whole life is in here I couldn't just leave it with CTA
You are an angel
Oh yeah
I'm trying to be a good little citizen  because I've lost my wallet on the bus before and someone got it back to me
"She has like a bank envelope in here with like a LOT of cash in it and then a bunch of other lose cash, her checkbook, important other cards"
It's been like 3 hours
And annoyed that I have to lug around this very large purse
But she still hasn't wrote back yet and now I'm a little worried
So I had mary use her connections to find someone who works at the county who got us her email and we contacted her
She's a 70 year old lady who lives on the Southside and works for the county
It's a huge purse with a bunch of money and important documents in it and stuff
My mom and I went to the museum this morning and we found a ladies purse on the red line

I do cool shit on my birthday
"On the summer solstice, the sun aligns perfectly with my rising moon and the pergola"
Too strong a word for Johnny stocks
"Listen, as soon anyone throws around the word annoying, I'm out!"
i never bought that it was johnâs bday no way he wouldnât have made us do some dumb shit for it
"Thatâs why he made pergola, for all the other sons of summer"
Thank god someone clarified I was about to send out a duel birthday wish as well. John doesnât have the personality of a winter birthday
WHAT
Did the birthday's curse do absolutely nothing?
Oh I'm sorry but it took you to Joey telling you?
Joey told me it was annoying that I did it
Ok guys I'm really sorry it's not my birthday
Happy bday Alex and John! I was trying to scare you in thinking I didnât careâ¦thatâs why I waited so long to send this
Me and Kari just got tix to go see nosferator at music box on 12/30 @645pm if folks wanna come

If any of these work for ya and you're able to come thru and get out by 7ish or so you can use these
Am totally flexible
Do u know what time you'd come thru
I will not harm them or damage them nor are they at risk of that happening
Are you gonna potentially break them and secretly replace them all?
Iâm looking for books that in some way either sensical or nonsensical âpairâ commercially together
Are u looking for a specific book
Does anyone have a sizable collection of books I could rummage through tonight and borrow for a video ?
"""Concrete crumbles"" is actually the flavor all of your birthday cakes now"

Eric Sony and Hypnosis set the nickname for Johnbo Walter Stockwell to Birthday's Curse Haver Enjoyer.
Birthday's Curse
No matter how many times you've voted for him
No president can save you now John
it's immortalized in the constitution
John doomed to watch the first half of whiplash over and over for eternity
only the president has the power to say you don't have a birthday
But my Birthday's Curse can
that's only a power the president has
No you're right I cant
The curse of immortality
YOU CAN'T DO THAT
You no longer have a birthday
Due to Birthday's Curse
Not anymore
WTF
ON MY BIRTHDAY?!?!
I'm actually placing a birthday curse on John Stockwell
In light of the revelations that have come to light
I'll try that
Then think about it
Youâre supposed to watch it all the way through
"everything I knew about it prior to watching made me also think, ""this guy seems like a jerk"""
this guy's a jerk
and i keep turning it on and off
I'm watching whiplash for the first time
Dunno where you got that from
ð¤
The way John has actually stolen birthday valor
hell yeah
This is a photo of me showing a child my leg injury video
"Happy John and Alexâs birthday! Or, as I like to call it,  John and Alexâs birthday"
"""Are your ready to choose your city?"""

Sorry I havenât been as active today during my normal adderrall hours
THC bomb in the beer tub >>>
there's a natural human urge to soak in a tub full of something that's not water
But still not sure of the benefits unless you had like an extremely misguided scheme to try to frame someone for drink driving or something
idc if it's good for me or not
I lowkey want it to be a bath full of beer
Ya it's not literally a bath full of beer I think it's like mostly like a hop water bath
don't worry about it
confused why beer would be good to soak in but iâm in
this sounds perffff
And the part where you actually take a bath in the beer/hop water is private for you and your partner
I think the only gendered part is the steam room? I can't remember if that's gendered but i think that's also optional
oh hell yeah ty!!
It's on Milwaukee
Piva I think?
Ya I did beer spa once I think it's p accommodating
got a 2nd round interview in thirty min ð¤
looking for the natural wine spa
you should ask one of them the only thing I remember is the phrase beer spa
beer spa??? iâm interested
can't remember what the deal with that is like
brook and annaleigh went to that beer spa one time
the only non naked spa is aire and itâs like 10000000 dollars
I was there on a heavy edible once and I thought everyone with a king spa shirt was working there like damn this place has a lot of employees
I like don't think anyone would be too weird on the dude side but I so get not risking it
They give you a uniform
the short king spa
we need a trans friendly spa
god dammit
yeah no clothes allowed in the baths parts
and u have to be naked right
You like king spa? Name every temperature they have.
I like the one where you  lie on a bunch of tiny wooden blocks
every temperature you can imagine
lol that's literally how I was gonna describe it
They have a bunch of rooms of various temperatures
what else can y do
everything else you can do co ed
the bath parts are the first thing you go through and those are gender separated
i asked before i know but i forget
or all naked gender separated
is king spa something u can do co ed
I celebrate the birthday of my friends who are landlords every day
Happy Birthday @Alex Berr and @Johnbo Walter Stockwell!

Also go to this place
Calling the police in 90 second intervals to ensure you will not get inside
Just don't want you seeing when I prank your home
Thanks man
What were your thoughts on this
"Good, don't set any cameras up"
I think if I set up a camera it would be weird for her and also I would get sad if he was meowy or sad looking
No I have a friend apartment sitting for me for Conan ðââ¬
Have an incredible time
Did you setup any cameras in your apartment?
What
Do me a favor when you get there
10am
What time are you leaving?
Canât suck own dick with it tho :(
Got an inflatable headrest for my flight
@Anthony Siraguse was my fart epic?
Just gets me riled up
Something about national policy positions
I feel like that's a strategy to get you to ask as few questions as possible and just give her what she wants
"I'm on the phone with a lady who was like ""what can I do for the mattress cover? My daughter's a big bleeder in her sleep. You know the morning gush."""
Still gotta Chris proof my back gate
I've Chris proofed my garage
Hahahahahahaha
Nvm donât wanna jinx it
have the best trip buddy @Aaron Klopfer
It was epic
Ty everyone who came to my Japan party
Damn ainât no way Chris Trani is getting in there
Whatâs your code again
Thatâs sick
My garage now has a key pad that works with the same system as the front gate
Amazing news
"Alright I'm about to head over, do you want me to bring anything @Aaron Klopfer"
And don't forget everything I taught you about japan
Hope you have a beautiful trip
Sorry matey don't think I'm gonna be able to make it out tonight
"Scratch that traffic is ass, 40 mins from now @everyone"
@everyone 30 mins from home if anyone wants to come before 7 ð¯ðµ
Bills/49ers should do the trick
Iâll put on Italian cinema so you donât get over stimulated
I think I can make it to this ð
"I've heard of reaching across the aisle but a REACH AROUND the aisle????????? Folks,"
"Might be more like 6:30

Might be more like 6:30
Some zionist type shit
One time he made a weird comment to a Muslim woman after her set at Logan Lounge
Yeah he kinda sucks
He got dropped as a producer on a suburbs show and got so mad he said he âknew some guys that could care herâ
Ok boomer
Iâll be back by 7
"I forgot I had to work at the wolves game until like 6:30, please still come by at 7:15 if you can for a hang tonight.

So bummed I agreed to work today :( @everyone"
And then try to watch South Park with her
I'm going to ask her if she's seen the matrix
Hereâs how you take it to the next level dude
Movies and Music and Family stuff
What did you guys talk about
Your ass isn't even on the forums!!
His wife left him for a fan
We are hanging out again today
Really good ngl
Shank how did your date go
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
You could have taught him so much
I could have stopped all this
He could have been my student
Yeah and Shankland is pissed because Fuentes is his hero
But also destiny is married and has a kid so there's more drama there
Destiny is a popular streamer and debate bro who is a liberal and Nick Fuentes is an out and out neo-nazi
What Iâm getting is thereâs a gay sex video and itâs pissing Andrew the F off
Idk what these words mean
Just a reminder to call and check on your friends like me they're going through a lot rn
I HAVE SO MUCH FAITH IN YOUR RESILIENCE RICHIE I'LL BET YOU DID SOMETHING SOOOO COOL INSTEAD
You literally said that
"âCancel your movie night Richie, Rebecca and I are going to be out all night!â"
I would go
We got A LOT done
Richie we had a VERY punctual night
WE HUNG THERE FOR AN HOUR!!!
OK SHUT THE FUCK UP

Iâd assume you would be at Le Bouchon
the charleston?
hey where should we all go for me and dannyâs anniversary next week
What a night
After a 5pm dinner
Can someone start a rumor about me please
Stockwell was at Charleston from 7:30-8
Was there a Charleston hang? I got a bunch of thirsty madison boys here
Having a beer at da lodge nvm
Where are you folks
In one minute
We're chillin still
How soon you gonna be here?
CAM IM SORRY IT WASNT CLEAR IF YOU WERE COMING OR NOT
But you brought the demons out of me
Normally i'd be a sucker for an anecdote about your family going to a play
Wait no I want to hear about Annie
Stop trying to distract from how you just tricked me into going to a bar with your anecdote
"Rebecca also went to Annie today with my mom, sister and niece lol"
You're ok king
Oh god what i get my self into
Ilona is such a massive flip flopper it's driving us nuts
It's me Rebecca and her friend ilona lmao
I'll give you a ride there
I can go hang at lodge instead tho
Like 10min away in uber
Are you on your way???
Wait lmao are you here
"You know, eat dinner and go out after and be home by 8"
Does anyone else want to hang out at charleston
Shit
Oh well
Pretty soon
We rolling
Come bitch

Fuck im sorry @Meg Mc fuck
When are you going there @johncrete
Heâs starting to sweat
No one say anything
Hahahahaha I'm sorry
Come hang
LONELY ASS MF
Hahahahaha
Felt funnier to imply your loneliness
Yeah I was gonna be more direct
I feel like you went through a few ideas before you got to this one
You eat dinner at 5pm?
Maybe your landlord can do one with u????
It's what you do when you have anniversary dinners
"You know, universal dinner time?"
"5, actually, dinner time?"
Did you guys have your anniversary dinner at 4pm?
Doing social media pics for da adopt ah dog night at da wolves
LOVE the charleston
Nevermind we're going to the Charleston
We're gonna come grab a drink at Whirlaway for a bit
I'd be down @johncrete lmk
I could be down for a good old fashioned bar hang
Or something nearby idk
We might head to a bar in andersonville
I thought Rebecca would wanna chill on going out tonight after dinner but we're at Sun Wah and she's talking about hanging later
Anyone going to any bars tonight?
The astronomical odds of having a pleasant interaction with noshod a few times
Literally goes youâve been nice to me
Also Marcos Lara response is funny
(i.e. comics)
Pat for the course named the group The Lower World.
Drake suing umg
Organize.
No idea why he thinks talking to Cole will fix it
Basil was canceled fully out of the whole scene btw
"Guy Glitterus â¦ âGlitterusâ , if you will"
Chicago needs a mic for men ð«¡ð«¡

Heart react to this
For whoeverâs going to doves luncheonette if I get there first how many seats should I get?
Should I do MacGruber tonight or push what do yall think??
He tucked himself in
I think he would be funnier if he smiled more
Reminds me of my favorite New Yorker satirist Tom Skewer
John with the first share on the video!
His captors are making him do these
So in that way hats off
It is about the same quality of about 60% of weekend update tbh
It drives me nuts how he's pronouncing legionnaires disease
WERE BACK!
https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCXxhfPg8jQ/?igsh=MWhrZ3VoaWZ0Z3NuZQ==
But goddamn
Don't
That'd be such a dunk comment
Goddamn lmao
Should have mentioned it when we were dunking on him earlier
Just remembered Jame Najar brought his gf to coles on Valentines day last year lmao
Over the garden wall is pro cop
Just walked past a house that had a thin blue line flag and they were watching over the garden wall on their big ass tv
I've been waiting for the right occasion
I'm debuting my nuggets crew neck that Mary got me for my birthday
ð¤¤
UGH fuck that I'm in my pajamies
iâm three minutes away
SIMONES
Where is EVERYONE GOING
Malfoy and Hermione become lovers
Ok screw it I'm headed up there now too
Rebecca and ilona are in bed reading a Harry Potter fan fic where everyone dies and all the women get handmaids tailed
iâm almost there!
Who is Simon
I'm married to the idea of having glÃ¶gg
Well I'm going to Simon's either way so hopefully I'll see y'all there
balding
Wait why isn't Tony getting his hair cut
yeah iâll head now if people are still hanging
"Yeah I thought I was gonna get off work a bit earlier, walking home now. If you guys are hanging for a bit longer I'll take an Uber down maybe"
Homewreckers
Or are you basically Dunne
Are y'all still hanging for a bit
More malls in Chicago!
It's really such a wonder
heâs the first line of defense in the war on christmas ð«¡
That Mickey Mouse goes hard
I love the mall
On my way to Simonâs
iâm the most attractive person here btw itâs awesome
ð
and thereâs a group of moms in the front doing âmEEEOWsâ at danny
iâm at the metro for phylzzzz opening for a band called chevy metal
I liked black ops 1 ð¤·ââï¸
It has more sequels than fast and furious
They keep making calls of duty lol
No it still hits
Is call of duty an outdated video game reference now?
I heard they hack credit cards there
Yeah Simonâs tavern glÃ¶gg glÃ¶gg
In Andersonville
Weâre doing Simonâs instead
They got a fried bologna sandwich on there
Dang how late do they serve food
Dis one?
They have glÃ¶gg :)
Oh shit I've always wanted an excuse to go there
Change of plan going to Simonâs tavern 9pm
It says 2025 but I think they mean tonight
Going to carolâs around 9pm come hang
"I went a few months ago, tbh kind of underwhelmed"
I'm going to the Wayfair store
iâll buy u a beerâ¤ï¸
can someone meet me there at 4 pm to take a pic of me fake puking for a show promo
speaking of how coleâs is 9/11
And we will NOT be bullied into having the biggest hack category taken away
The Gay-Ellieâs
We should host a chat award show
He once lectured me on how Coleâs is âbumper bowlingâ for people who want to get Broad City back in the air
With great crowds
Like bombed hard
Hahahahaha he has been there so many times and bombed every time
Could make an argument that heâs the worst comedian in Chicago
Comedy Gazelle shouldnât have taken James Najjar winning biggest hack back
Iâve seen James. He was bad
Iâve never seen Bob Keen go to Coles
block party on kms avenue tonight
I canât believe James Najjar went with a 9/11 joke in the comments
yeah those were mean!
Can Bob and James be banned too
Itâs so hard to find parking on kms avenue
Banning from doing comedy could be seen as a blessing
Literally every woman has a bad story about him
"He sucks kristi, donât let him get you down. Heâs so disingenuous with why he was banned"
Since he claimed he got hacked bots have been responding to him
You handled it really well and you deserved more support earlier on
Iâm sorry you had to deal with this
even when deserved
itâs better this way but i will say banning people feels bad
Every single week he does something worthy of being banished
Even without being a creep he bullied an autistic man
Itâs the comedy version of an incel
god iâm gonna miss the way he brought energy into the room at all these shows
It was my greatest trick yet
Heeee showed up wasted and said some really rude shit
He shows up when you need him the most
i love that on kms avenue week for kristi noshod hopped in to play
At least he will learn and grow from without a doubt
and when i described everything to dustin and morgan they were like u know u can ban people right
he also grabbed the sign up list from me aggressively
Yeah Joey instigated by assuming the best out of people
So he had to be weird
You put him around women
Yeah he was setup to be weird
u guys set me up to be weird at crushes haahahah
he was like
when i told him i wasnât gonna bump him bc he makes my friends feel weird
Little did he know his email in bio could also be used for unbookingd
"Dustin, welcome to the resistance ð«¡"
I am Jewish in response to my unsend
i talked to dustin and morganâs about like WVERYTHING with him
i didnât even try to ban him
Can we get a behind the scenes Kristi
iâm sure itâs a very busy email box happy he saw it
his bio says âemail for bookingsâ
itâs in his bio
Ummmmm worst parent ever!!!?!??!
hahahahahaha
Iâd take a humper over a sitter any day
It's for humping
It's not even what the stool is for
To think you have that kind of hold over the room
If your legs are tired just lean against the wall
Truly the gall of an open micer who sits down during their set
It's offensive to think you get to sit down
Ban all stool sitters
How did coles get his email address?
oy
"Can u guys send me your favorite Spotify playlists ð¥¹ 

Iâm back on it"
Only thing I run to is the polls
Of all the scams you run you're gonna pay full price for software smh
Letâs all be media editing pilled
Adobe is half off for a year rn
Jesus Christ

Watching a Jan 6 doc and there's a guy that thinks getting everyone to smoke weed with him in the rotunda stopped everyone from turning violent lol
I bet it feels so good to lay down on an empty room carpet

Thatâs awesome
Camâs feet and ham
How was the chat thanksgiving did you guys have a nice time?
they were just mad we werenât playing divorced-at-24 tik tok country music
we were playing country music!!!
went to a strip mall bar that had a sign that said âthe country side of Columbusâ in the window and took over the touch tunes and the waiter came over and told us âyall are playing some interesting music tonightâ
If anyone wants dessert hereâs camâs feet

Bros just coming thru
and he was like iâm doing the mic
i was like dad please donât come iâll be busy and itâll be weird
Ugh that is a lot to handle but also kind of sweet that heâs using the mic to check in
and he wonât stop coming to hangouts
(bc i said i was gonna kms a few days ago)
my dad thinks iâm gonna kms
jesus christ
Yeah I think if we did it later at like 830 or 9 we could do a screening Sat nite
*Thegreatgatsbyshow
But does anyone know thegreatgataby show on IG? Ive asked him to confirm whether im on saturday like 4 times and he keeps telling me im booked for other things but not responding when i ask stuff
I think i have a show
Lemme get back to ya
Think Iâd be down
I also know cam will want to watch and I think he works until 7 but I havenât confirmed
Tbh you were the impetus for wanting to screen since you havenât seen so basically you can pick the time
I got stuff I gotta do but if I can make it work and it were late enough I'd be game
What time were you thinking
Okay I asked the other day but it might have gotten buried. Would Saturday work for a MacGruber screening for anyone? Or should I try a different day
True thank you
He probably thought it was funny
I feel kinda guilty. Whats the best way to feel better about this?
Anthony Jeselnik saw my story where I said he looks like a pedophile

"I went on a date on Sunday and the girl was like ""how is hinge different in Chicago?"" And I was like ""uh....there's not as many people"""
"Yeah Shank Iâll send you $20 to say âif youâre looking to fuck with someone, look no further than the Shankmanâ"
Sounds like it's your time to swoop in.
And then everyone else was like trying to get in on the conversation
"This one woman was like ""if nobody else going to fuck with me then I'm going to keep fucking with my ex"""
What stuff
Real Teachers of New York
That's sick
All my coworkers are talking about fucking and stuff
Going solo so just trying to socialize before my main interactions are with tourists
Is this small bar?
bro came thru
Trump is sending in the national guard
Thereâs literally ten of them now
"Fold two shirts, 2 pants, and 2 socks blindfolded!"
Yeah see if they're cut out for the laundry corps
Hahahahaha
Itâll remind them of the recruiter who first tricked them
Iâm gonna set up a pull-up bar for them they love that kind of shit
Thank them for their service
Does Uncle Sam not have in unit?
Yo how come there are three troops at my laundromat rn?
"Iâm so excited (not actually mad, just fun to mess with her)"
Also! Olivia had my umbrella I lost with my companies old logo on it so Iâm going to give her so much shit haha
Not too bad! Only on one crutch today so I can hold an umbrella!

A worker I always talk to at target asked if I knew Kristi Durkin lol
Feeling feral
Bad month
Serves you right for messing with John
Cam and I were definitely overcharged last night
How is everyone doing?
It's an interesting take on a quality piece of media
"Honestly, it's not bad so far"
Please keep me posted what you think of the show i wish i had more people to talk to about it!
I didn't come out to hang
I went home
Yeah I'm not their either
You have to keep watching my gat vampire show
No everybody went home
Are you guys still at small bar
But skeptically
I'll continue watching
There's something VERY fishy about this
Stop being so charming
Manipulative and charming
I wish he didnât do that because a show rec from cam is usually great but rn itâs a prank probably
This is all very Lestat of you
This is what he said he was going to say while laughing about you falling for his stuff
Richie... i dont like joking around about this because nobody ever follows through on my show recs and the fact that john is watching this means so much to me
I was like âthatâs not niceâ but cam kept saying âI donât care about Johnâs time!!!! Iâm evil!â
At small bar cam was laughing so hard saying âJohn is going to be watching this bi show but itâs actually very averageâ
Its just such an incredible show
Lestat is very bi but also very abusive
@johncrete  im sorry if i promised more bi
Ok there has been ONE bi interaction so far among many gay interactions in interview with a vampire
Yes!
Are people still at Small Bar??
It's not like a traditional place by any means but just v solid and nice and not too expensive
We've only been once but Saba on Milwaukee
You know what's kinda slept on that's solid
These also look excellent!
yes!!
I like segnatore in humboldt. Thereâs also this spot called void in Avondale that just opened that I wanna check out.
Is it quiet enough to converse comfortably??
im there rn!!
Had no idea this existed next to Andros! Great suggestion
Looking it up rn!
mano o mano!
Give my love to KPD Iâm catching up w old friends tn
"Speaking of, does anyone know of a good Italian restaurant in the Logan-Wicker-Bucktown area or adjacent that is quiet and not super scene-y but decent and not $$$? like Buona Terra in Logan before it closed?"

Good cheese curds too

They have food right
Also lil reminder that we're doing a lil hang for Kari's bday tonight at small bar at 9pm if anyone is free and wants to come out and celebrate
Not sure but they really make it seem if you are probably ATF then you must hate or want to destroy dogs

Illinois SOS answered at 31 minutes

We need a de-huh-drator for the chat when John posts
I will restrict your access to the venue of the future
Freeze until Christmas Eve
Actually it makes jerky
We need a deli insider
THIS!!!!!
Actually just start working at the deli again
You know perfectly well how much sense it makes
Lol Ian beat me to it
Hmm
Huh?
"Dehydrator? What does it do, send the meat to Humboldt at 10am?"
Yeah screw the grinder get yourself a dehydrator
Jerky
Of all the meats Iâve had venison is by far one of them
"Let Kerry get the meat grinder then she can grind all our meats for us too, dumbass!"
I had to do a double take
"Pat for the course voted for ""Yes"" in the poll."
Do you have to put it in a condom or could you put it in other things
great mis en place for sausage making
All is well
Look at the peace and order in this photo
I love stock photos
"the lil beekeeper's son voted for ""Yes"" in the poll."
apple martin created a poll: Should I host MacGruber screen...
This is a beanbag lmao
"I remember the time Rebecca bought a ""moon chair"" for $300 during the pandemic"
I think Kerry should get the meat grinder but idk I guess I just listen to women???
ð
"See, I'm just here to back up Chet"
No no no no no! You can just get them to do it for free!
look at this beauty
also I used to work at a meat counter and we had to clean the grinder between each different meat so if someone came in with deer meat to grind Iâd be kind of annoyed lol
you donât understand I want to buy the meat grinder
No need to buy a meat grinder!!!!
If you ask the meat counter at the deli I think they'll do it for you!
I was thinking shepherds pie bc thatâs the only way Iâve had venison before but also it means I would have an excuse to buy the meat grinder attachment for my stand mixer lol
what should I do with it?
It's so good
Deer meat rocks
was given fresh deer meat at the polka night afters

What time are you guys going?

Hahahahahahahaha
"Basically itâs Ian with The Rock and JK Simmons, but donât call him a boner"

@Adam McShane showed me the pic
Im sorry
Whaaat that seemed like a big show

so sad i missed wicked to do a show at the den that got cancelled
Wicked ripped
We ran into these guys!!!
Iâm pretty sure bill gevirtz showed it to me
Itâs like Iâm the only one getting those Pedro pascal TikToks

You guys donât let me flop on this itâs too embarrassing
I should emphasize I only want to go with people that are also going to be horny for all the actors in it
Giantspeak be like
Like crazy she's making significantly less
This woman is a para professional but basically foes the same job as me
But ya idk that was my big takeaway I'm left thinking about is how could we make here more like over there
That's not to say we as a people don't also have a greater culture where we treat teachers and service industry and retail like shit
That was the biggest takeaway from Japan for me is how blatantly better off everyone seemed to be there and how that highlights just how bad and worse people are treated here
Yeah man it's really wretched
Like how sad someone that also works at a public school has a second job :(
*from a woman
I just bought fries at Popeyes from I work with. I've never felt worse about this country
Unfortunately i cannot see g2 tomorrow
You can really tell i watched a youtube video
Like all the memorable lines everybody knows
Did you know for gladiator 1 the script sucked so most of the movie is stuff they came up with while filming on set
Maybe tomorrow? Or literally whenever Iâm not leaving town this week!

So you could really have a fine time at the cinema w our friends

Bruce!!!!!!
I'm gonna look up the plot on wickedpedia ð¤£ð¤£
And what better way to get informed than by watching the first half of the prequel to the movie
Itâs possible that the only reason that you donât like the wizard of Oz is because you only know half the story
Assuming Ian and kari are 5-6? Or we'll make some new friends
I hate musicals and the wizard of oz do you think Iâll like this movie
Cool got M7-8
Yep!

Hearing your upstairs neighbor fuck after a breakup is not a fun experience.
"Thanks for letting us know about things being fucked, we care and shit"
You are very easy to interact with
Overwhelming and unnecessary ð¢
iâve just had so much conflict this last month it really broke me tbh!!!
i think heâs always been bad but itâs gotten exponentially worse and i tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and was real with him and he freaked out on me
So glad to hear this
I would have the same reaction
"just took
a second for me to come forward with because i used to be friends w him tbh and it just made me anxious and sad"
victoria had my back and so did the bar!
Too tired for this

This is very unusual
Ok now it sounds like I think they normally get a Japanese audience
I've never been more upset after a good set
"And i feel a deep loss that, had i known that, it would have been the best set of my life to adult play with that"
But also i only learned afterwards that a lot of japanese people were using google translate on their phones to understand the sets
It was so fun
Love it when that happens
"Laugh Factory had a Japanese audience tonight, huh?"
how did the set go
The japanese people adore me

You could try reaching out to Sophie Biddle? Not sure if that would also put u in a don't shoot the messenger type situation
Fuck Brian hicks and fuck zanies and fuck Fiji water
ugh that sucks dude iâm so sorry
I was even nervous to post it in the chat honestly
like yeah he probably wouldnât even get a slap on the wrist
i wonder what would even happen if u just like posted that DM online
no literally
I know and itâs that shitty thing where Iâm kind of ashamed of myself for letting it happen but also I donât want to kneecap myself for nothing
i get keepin chill for ur career it just sUCKS thatâs such an annoying dm
ugh i know ur right im just like god damn i wish they would get put on blast
Heâs in charge
or a random
is brian the guy in charge there
But like what would change? Who would care? Iâd just get blacklisted there
Also he couldâve just said âwe already booked a hostâ he didnât have to explain that itâs because youâre a woman
idk megan i feel like you could literally put him on blast rn
"""I'm fat as hell!!!"" ð"
He's so likeable women relate to him too
"Peyton is really kind of an everywoman, not just an everyman"
is brian the booker guy
wait nvm zanies
what venue is this
oh my god hahaha
He had Peyton Ruddy host for Steph Tolev last year
â¦it was me
I am certain the man he chose will be wildly out of place and not vibe with the crowd at all
"He wanted to make sure we knew, this is Trump's America now"
Why not just say you already have a host
"Yeah there's literally nothing you could say that wouldn't just cement his decision, that sucks"
Hahahahahahahahaha
This is for Sophie Biddle. I donât think her fans are begging for male voices
Watching the crowd slowly get confused and angry when they realize they donât get to hear a man speak for once
You know what women love? Slumber party vibes
So I canât âmake a sceneâ
"What is this, a woman themed show?"
"And Iâm such a shill I just gave a thumbs up because tragically, I do still want to work there"
The human mind simply cannot comprehend three women on a show
And the male feature that was booked simply *didnât show up*
Had to watch Ralphie Roberts do a set about trying to get laid and also being married for 25 years
"Also explains why I only ever host for male headliners who, guess what, donât really care for my vibe!"
Iâm gonna burn that place to the ground what the hell
I want to just send this in response
"There are all-male host, feature, headliner shows all of the time"
INSANE reasoning
????????????????

@Richie Owens do any scenes in movies come to mind for violent muggings
Oh hmm
Just 2 blue line stops
No the one on belmont/kedzie
The one across from target got closed?
And I always felt kinda judged there idk
They got bought by LA fitness and closed the most convenient location for me so that was the last straw
Yeah it sucks it's gross
Xport
Didn't like the other place?
Renewed my planet fitness membership

Horse rug chat
We were so close to all having horse rugs
"Yeah, but he could never best the might of American industry"
This was when medieval Europe was mad weak and stretched thin
He got to the borders
Dude ghengis khan was about to take over Europe but then he died
China really slaps them around these days
Chet hanks favorite country is âMongolia
(don't tell anyone I told you)
It's actually where Gehghis Kahn is buried
I see nothing wrong with what Joey said
"Yeah, so at least 20% of people"
I wish the pergola did more to celebrate the Mongolian empire
The horse rug will be my pergola
My current rug got ruined ð¡
Itâs less flooded but theyâre still working on it
that depends on if your apartment is still flooded
Do you guys think I should buy this horse rug
Iâm sitting next to a lady at a coffee shop whoâs trying to sell a Tesla over the phone
@Aaron Klopfer We have not!
"I would never purchase a woman. They are people and not property, Aaron"
Women are 85% of all purchases
@Cameron Gillette did you and da girl text yet? ð¥¹
Pickme lotion ð¤
jr bacon CEO
Lotion for men for women is such a good idea
women are at least 20% of the market
I have been toying with this concept: what if we also sold products to women?
If you don't have a result it's bc you're still searching for the best way that something can be done
Saying that you want to search or investigate is great bc it sounds smart but it never promises and end result
Layout a plan for a rival and better company
and everyone can take turns being gay or straight
In five years I hope they'll have figured out conversion therapy
You should say you want to investigate ways to innovate the way your job is done
ooh I love that
no I leave the lotion sales to more qualified people I just help the guys who already bought the lotion
"In five years, you see yourself settling down with a wife and kids. You hope to have climbed the ladder enough to provide a comfortable, suburban living for your wife and beautiful daughter"
What is ur job? Lotion salesman?
Yeah 5 year plans are bs you just gotta find a way to write some goals that dont make it seem like you a promising to do more or deliver higher quality work
Aspirational but non threatening
this reminds of the religion classes I had to take in grade school
Say you wanna be CEO jr
what's the kind of five year plan that the world's dumbest ceo might like to see
catalina wine mixer sent an attachment.
Com Ed sent me an email that our power is off till 1pm ð¥²

Ijust submitted to be on my strange addiction

@Caroline Twyman @Johnbo Walter Stockwell
i was gonna make a joke about speed but you beat me to it. guess they call that slow joking ð¤£
I sorta mightve! It was more fun than i thought it would be!
Did you meet anyone??
Who was the fastest
Very fun speed dating night with klopf
I had to explain to everyone at speed dating that i wrote straightish because i wouldnt go to a thing like that to meet men
Some people drove three hours to do 2 minutes
So today there were 37 comics and everyone got 2 minutes
The mic in Charlottesville does this crazy thing where instead of capping sign ups they adjust the amount of time everyone gets
Put him in here
And found out he works at the winery Iâm starting work at on Wednesday ðð
Just got unsolicited advice from an unfunny dude at an open mic ð
We both cumâd
Me and cam went speed dating
that place was special
thatâs how i feel about it
Frankly I can drive just fine as long as I donât get caught
Itâs only come up once in like 5 years for me
Ok thank you thatâs huge
The cycle continues
Lmao it was the previous tenant
when I was living there we actually did get a rock thrown through our window ð«¶
Rock window?
and not a door I can directly knock on
thereâs not a doorbell for that apartment
Ring door
Imo just go to old address in person
but like I literally sent a letter to my old address and tried getting in touch with my old landlord and have heard nothing so I think o have to just declare it lost/stolen
I tried to renew via the kiosk and they sent that one to the wrong address and I havenât been able to get in touch with the people who live there now and the woman at the dmv right now kept being like I canât issue you a new ID you need to go claim the ID because your identity is floating around and someone could take that ID and throw it in a crime scene then theyâd blame you for the crime
THE WORLD IS RUN BY LANDLORDS AND FOSSIL FUELS LIBS ðª
Chat thought they could just ride bikes the rest of their lives
Looooool
I am currently in drivers license bureaucracy hell right now so this is close to mind ð«¶
they release the appointments at 6:30am everyday so you have to wake up early to book
Might have been because PA doesn't make you take drivers ed
I had to take a written test when moved from PA to get an IL license
If you just have a state ID and not a license
Looooool you might have to do a road test
God I'm just imagining the child like falling off the foot thing and flailing around
That's so funny
Hahahahahaha
canât stop cracking up at this
Or I'm sure someone on reddit has had the same problem
Give a call and explain ur situation and ask what all will be needed from you
Ok yeah IDK how that all is gonna work out
What's the matter with you
U just have an IL ID?
Iâve never had a license in Illinois
I think u can do online if ur at the same address as your prior license
Personally it would be very convenient if I could just grab one next week
Politically i think driverâs test should be stringent bc we donât do enough to recognize that these things are death machines that cause millions of deaths every year
But everything online is just if youâre over 21 just show up and pay $30
I think they just check you're vision
I haven't had to do a road test since ever
I surrendered my Wisconsin license five years ago to get an IL ID so Iâm like wonât I have to do a road test again
I don't think it took me more than an hour overall besides traveling there and back but it's hard to say bc I also got lunch after
Show up with proof of residency and whatever else Id you need
Go to the one in Chinatown on a weekday before noon
I think when I converted to MN to Illinois I just walked up too
I had to renew mine bc of an address change and I just went
No
Do u have an il license already
Did you have to take tests?
All the Chicago places say no available appointments so Iâm like do I just walk in with all the ids like âlemme drive a carâ
Gotta use crypto forms and lib bucks to fill out your government freedom form
We're in the future now
Sorry boomer
"When we went home earlier this year, Rebecca's dad was annoyed that this government agency he was working with wouldn't take a physically mailed in form"
It's sick
Everything is like online now
Honestly navigating government bureaucracy has never felt easier
After I showed two forms or whatever
"I think you have to make an appt now, but when I did it I walked in and they were like here you go"
Yeah I have
Hey next Monday is Karis bday and she is having a lil get together at small bar at 9pm if anyone will be free and wanna meet up

Also only murders in the building is good sick day vibes
I Said it privately but bad sisters is very good
Just objectively not good jokes
It's tough when you know the jokes are bad
Man I couldn't last even like a minute in
They're all just so selfish and petty it rocks
it's literally what if West Wing was good
Sorkin could never
I like how only some of the characters are actually clever and most are just dumb
that was a huge relief
will update my veep journey
iâm so glad we figured out what iâm watching tho thanks guys
Some of the richard splett stuff of the funniest shit I've ever seen on tv
this is my new binge
I think the finale is my favorite tv episode
It's SOOOO good
Veep is so rewatchable bc I never remember all the mean little things they say so they always catch me by surprise
Jesus Christ this is from when I like just moved to Chicago
also girl ofc iâve seen salt lake city
Like it's fictionalized but it is based on somewhat real things that go on
"Penn State has literally been taken over by high rise buildings, it's insane"
i have a hard time watching boy shows
i just wanted something w a girl in it i think
Veep is so good
oh wait iâll watch veep
It's kind of like veep where you're like ok the people who run our lives really do live like this and do things like this
It's tough when it's rainy out
"See, I don't think you should. Contempt is a rocketship to the top"

It is good
Otherwise the only things I ever watch are star trek and sopranos lol
no i want something thatâs like Good
Real life Truman show
Great british bake off is good for turning off your brain too
Secret lives of Mormon wives also very good
Honestly if you want to just completely rot and binge something insane real housewives of salt lake is pretty wild if you can stomach it
joey*

u have to watch white lotus
Oh white lotus slaps
The contestant on Hulu
so that the next time I'm sick I can finally start white lotus or whatever

If you donât watch it Iâll kill myswlf
Detroiters is on Netflix now
I almost never watch the popular tv show of the time
Itâs a doc
Go on Hulu and watch the contestant

"Genius, God bless the library"

Those kids will look back in 20 years and be proud that they stood for something

Itâs pretty legal to make your employees do a bunch of weird stuff
he 100% voted for Trump
the day after the election he came into the office and sang 3 little birds to everyone
Neither of those are fair to ask
How is this even legal Iâm not trying to do a bit

Iâve just kinda learned how to skim
i donât get how people handle the machete chris responses i would kms
like iâve been avoiding ever asking to do  a show for 3 years now
i just donât have enough good mental health to submit to stuff in general hahaha
So even if u don't get booked right away it would get you in the process to get booked v quickly
Seems like he sends that as a default but then books those people before you know it
but i am gonna just bite the bullett and submit today
i am so scared to submit to paper machete bc idk if my brain can take a novel response to why itâs just not the right time for me
Yeah he keeps talking about it Iâm gonna ignore
Like that feels like something micropeens get off on
I honestly think he only responded because he wanted you to ask to see it
Yeah im gonna get called a micropenis hating bitch
When can we have a pergola party
"Itâll be like:
Hey 
Hey
I knew u were a bitch
Hey"
This is the kind of dude that will call you a bitch when you stop responding

I have a theory that my dick gonna merge in ur mouth
Only to start the cycle all over again
"I have a theory that group chats expand continuously until they merge into one, super massive group chat consuming all other groups chats and spinning wildly out of control until it disperses scattering it's members into incalculable other smaller groups chats"

Jack rocks
My king of kings
It was like âhey sick to see you!â And then kinda fizzled
i donât know what i did before this group chat
Andrew and I ran into Jack at a show here
Because he showed me a meme Jack made about Laughable News
Iâm guessing Ricardo too
I think Knute is in the Jack Allen one
Life is so beautiful. Everyone has their little group chats
Wait who is in that one
One time Jack Allen was telling me about his group chat and I was just like I canât imagine
A sit down with the five families
Thereâs probably like 8 group chats and Laughable News is getting posted in all of them
Yalta Confrence of Chicago comedy
You canât ban queer joy thatâs what I always say
thatâs for the queer chat

Sorry Iâve had 1 beer

Thatâs the clear 3rd
Iâve been saying basketball game

and then colin ungers chat also has the same people they shit talk
"What can I say, I love to bet on the ponies!"
yes we did go over all the same people we shit talk
Iâm in both chats and we make fun of the exact same people in both but the other one talks about gambling more
horrible ratio i had to send them an excel spreadsheet with all the women they could add in
Yeah what's the gender ratio in the main chat ð¤ð¤ð¤
That being said? Happy birthday to Mitchell ð
"And I love Hunter, but of course he wants an all male chat"
Youâre our Snowden
devastating
and hunter went to shanker âoh damn dude ur in THE MAIN chatâ
and shanker named off everyone in his
and i named off everyone in this one
was w hunter hirsch and max shanker last night and we were talking about our respective group chats
HAPPY BDAY MITCHELL
I'm sure they'll have the main fight going on on the first floor
Well how about if anyone wants to have a beer before Mitch's and watch some amateur boxing fights  they're welcome to come over around 7 and then we can carpool over to schubas around 8-830
Damn
That would be my guess! 4 fights that start at 7 pm. Not sure how long those first three will go but Iâve gotta assume at least an hour
Well that's gonna cut into our beautiful Mitchell time
10 eastern?
So the Tyson Paul fight probably wonât go on until like 10
Ya I wanna try to quick go to the gym before how about folks start showing up around 630ish
Of da Paul Tyson rounds
Could at least watch a couple rounds
If Jake Paul wins Iâm burning the pergola down
Also I think I can have a few folks over before Mitch's to watch the fight just react to this if you wanna come over before
It was nice seeing u at schubas I hope u have a great night
Yoo happy birthday Mitchell!!!
I just want to reiterate happy birthday @Mitchell Potts
Think like when SpongeBob faced off with King Neptune on cooking burgers but take out the spatulas and they're touching
Unfortunately I only know how to explain this competition in terms of hamburgers
I'm not sure
So itâs like Joey Chesnut vs Kobayashi but instead of hot dogs itâs punches?
Itâs gonna be a Dave chappelle special
Which I feel is a big get
It's actually on Netflix
Blood sports are always pulling that shit
Is the fight not pay per view?
Ya lemme circle back later I wanna run it by Kari otherwise we can meet at a bar or something
Your place
Wanna watch with your cats
Wait you prob miss your cats
Crowds suck tho
Johns place it is
It also might make sense to go to a bar close to schubas I feel like theyâll drag the fight out with preliminarily fights
Aaron's place is further from schubas than your place Ian
Lemme circle back closer to game time
Wicker
Where's ur place with respect to schubas
We can also go to a bar or something nearby schubas thatâs playing it
My place or ur place @Ian Erickson
Share if u agree
Very disappointed
"I can't go to Mitchell's tonight though unfortunately, I'm going to a surprise party for Julia"
Maybe yeah
Oh maan
Anyone wanna pregame Mitch's and watch the Paul - Tyson fight
Thank you guys!
Happy birthday Mitchell!!!!
We love @Mitchie !!! Happy birthday @Mitchie !!!
Oh hell yeah. Canât wait to see everyone! Gonna be a fun night
Happy birthday mitchie! See ya at schubas!
Oh hell yeah
I canât wait to go to Schubas to celebrate with all my friends
Thank you!
Happy birfday @Mitchie
She's truly the best
canât believe iâve never seen her set until tn
kristen toomey is soooo nice
heâs the rookie of the year
I was doing so good not having to learn what the rizzler is and now it's he's become too much of a cultural force for me to ignore him. Hats off to the young man
Me in another life
Taylor swift can get a million likes. How about our celibate lads? ð«¡ðºð¸âªï¸âï¸
Housing office Sam seems to be settling into his routine ð
She didnât even like my joke
Weâve had to call the cops on her so many times haha
"Then she told me to be a man and stand on my own feet and I got to say âI canât, Iâm on crutchesâ"
"A tenant who is pretty insane that screams every time she comes into our office was like âthey canât fire you, why are you scared of them?â When I told her I wouldnât do something for her and I had to be like absolutely they can??"
Is this you bruce?
Yeah was not a dig on the producers theyâre all great. Revival is just in a tourist-y part of town
"I thought revival was fun, also I like knutes demeanor running a show"
â¤ï¸
Also if anyoneâs office job is hiring I need to get away from Trader Joeâs while I get going on the internship
Tourists? They were a very tense crowd when I was there but Iâve heard other times itâs fine
whatâs the vibe
Yeah
Her eye literally twitching
The day after the election I looked miserable and a coworker asked  âWHAT SEASONAL PRODUCT ARE YOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT??!â
so major fuck trader joeâs
"Iâm at the point of wanting to cry at work, this is huge"
congrats buddy
yooooo!!!
Itâs probably gonna suck but itâs a good foot in the door
Just got an internship for social media content
anyone ever done the revival theater
Neighbor is icing me after his partner kept flirting with me
I replaced twitter with Blue sky and I replaced reddit with pokemon trading card game

Art dealer is my favorite character he's such a chode
You literally just did I'm only one episode in
"Nick, Garrett, Ramses, and Stephen are all chill"
So let's not spoil anything?
Ok I'm on episode 5?
The birth control stuff was wack
I feel like we're not talking about the same season
Yeah
RAMSES IS GHOULISH??????
this season had the most ghoulish men of all time
It's about love dipshit! Not people swinging!
what did you want it to be like Love is Blind: Habibi?
What the fuck are you TALKING ABOUT
This season had good draama
Skip

Are you guys gonna go to Coleâs? Trying to decide if itâs worth ubering/putting on real clothes
Give her her keys back

I'd add them to the group chat
The artist formerly known as?
has anyone heard of Tommy Schneeman
"hey fun group topic, if you told your boss âi hate waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night, this isnât fun anymore and i am broken.â what would you want your boss to reply with? how would you feel best supported ð"
Limes go left
Fixed it
ð¤
ð
Hmm good luck finding people willing to hang out with him
Hmm. So youâve just been ignoring all the articles Iâve been sending you then
Also some good news: my kid has all his vaccines now so he can hang more
Yep 9 cst

iâm brain dead on the whole scheduling interviews in diff time zones thing
i have a dumb question

Kristi are u hosting early or late Cole's
But I live to ball
I was born to plow ð
a solid boy with which to plow his fields
But dumb as dirt
"My neighbor's dad loved me because I was big, I was like Sam"
Never was me
Hahahahahahaha
she thought I was too annoying for that to be true
I still remember my friend's mom being audibly shocked when she found out I had the best grades in my class in middle school
His answering machine bit was crushing last night
Me and stock well keep doing the fresh faces show together
hahah man parents hated my ass as a kid
I miss that about being a kid
"I was telling John, parents always loved talking to me"
That's really good
Hahahah
"Just wanna shout out @johncrete's funny joke at LF last night, he went up after @Samy Dick and said ""give it up for Sam everybody, every dad's dream son"""
GET HER ASS!!!!
Pfhhhhh
wanna comment so badly i promise nobody stole that disaster girl

Anybody trying to see Heartbreak Kid at music box on Sunday?
The childâs name? Jim Davis III
The duality of 4th grade man
Before this it showed the author and said his hairline is cooked and he looks like he has autism
The cats favorite food is pasta
Kid I volunteer with drew me this
A kid got in trouble during a fire drill today because he kept screaming that he was being kidnapped and a woman across the street waiting for the bus started filming lol
so weirdly it was news?
it wasn't laughable but I genuinely did learn something from the Uranus video
Thanks Brian
I still need to watch that one
just him pronouncing Uranus. not a joke in sight
omg the last one he posted was so good
Does Laughable News count as a podcast?
The homeostasis award

Ian after returning from Japan
followed through on this
can we protest with FREE ZAKO signs>
I was GLUED to my phone
it was probably my fav day in the group chat
"Laugh all you want, before I die I'm getting an EGGOT"
i wanna go this year
Everyone is right though
And that was one of the funniest things Iâve ever seen
Iâll always have a soft spot for the Gazellies because it gave the world the Zako-Mack fight
i canât believe we have gun and gazelle also has fun
Itâs astonishing how many comedians cant understand joking
Sort of a âwho is this for?â Kinda thing
Gazelles are very similar to when a college theatre department does its own award show
maybe we will be ok
i did find out all of the people we shit talk in this group chat are also mentioned in another group chat
EXACTLY
"people always jump to the defense of jerry and the gazelle bc they're putting on good shows or whatever but it's like, can't a guy just make fun of someone for doing something dweeby anymore?"
yes
This would be so funny
Letâs give Blake burkhardt rookie of the year
Is there not a cunty award this year?
We can all put you for Most Improved
Or is that a bit that can only result in me having to go to the Gazellies
Should I campaign super hard for a Gazellie
ð
Ian's BACK????
"aaron ""59 likes"" klopfer set the nickname for Kristi Durkin to didn't mean to change name sry."
Japan was great but it's good to be home
"aaron ""59 likes"" klopfer set the nickname for Kristi Durkin to sasa."
Could we all hold hands there
I'm being sober and that sounds like the perfect environment
wait we should make a good form to attend a bender
hahahahHA
We could do a chat trip to go see them every single night
itâs kinda cool in the sense thatâs itâs like tour but every night u get to go home to ur gf kristi
I wouldn't do it unless it paid enough to take more than a month off
iâm likeâ¦. feeling happy but conflicted about it for him lol
no days off
Might genuinely cause an injury
It would definitely be kind of cool to get that many reps in but no breaks at all is nuts
Wait like no days off?
but itâs like thereâs never a Good month to do a show everyday i guess
the drama is that we were gonna go on a family trip and i was gonna film my special the month they asked
hAHAHA
wait i just got booked on some barstool show
Honestly could be an incredible creative process
Yeah there is no parking or bike parking over there. That is an insane offer in general. Liars Club is the new Vegas
That feels like durational performance art
and i donât fuck w the regulars but i do like the venue
It's really in a fucked up random part of Fullerton there's like nothing around it for two blocks
they have weird regulars
"itâs like,,, i like it but im like jesus everyday at liars club sounds like a lot"
Man I've always wanted to see what that place is like on the inside I've gone by it so many times
itâs ALWAYS like that
lol phylyzzz just got asked to do a month long residency for liars club where they would play everyday for 30 days
Couldn't find my cat for like 10 mins and was frantically searching around having a minor panic attack and then when I finally found her under the couch she was looking at me like this
EXACTLY
I never hear of these guys until theyâre the most influential thing on the internet
also i think i donât realize how big he is bc i never really looked him up bc the vibe seemed off
idk i totally agree it sucks but im like god damn i have to book people every week and now i have assassinate kill tony?
a cumtown residency is a cumtown residency
Humiliating
Like imagine liking the president
Last thought is that they feed off of feeling like they're edgy and counter cultural but guess what trump won the popular vote that's your guy
if this is your attempt to get crushes to stop booking nick mullen it will not work
If you could go back in time would you kill baby Bob keen?
Exactly I'm saving their lives
What are you stopping them from doing? Most of the Kill Tony heads are dogshit at comedy and donât do anything besides the worst open mics imaginable
When actually it's so lame
I just think you run the risk of making it seem cool
The next Rogan will be Shanklandâs fault
I can't stop joe Rogan but I've met a lot of guys that I probably could have
"I just think about the open micers that are like ""oh I like kill tony"" and maybe I could have done a better job explaining why I think it's bad to them"
I think at a local level it's important to call out people when they buy into that shit and not fuck w them
I think you need to mock them more than anything
THANK YOU
I do think Bruce is right tho
"Yeah, and I think the new ones are going to be floating around the orbit if what already exists"
Those guys are too big to stop but there are new ones started every day
Obviously I'm thinking beyond what reality is right now but I'm trying to think what are the steps we can take
Because younger comedians aren't going to see these platforms as a route to success if using kill Tony as a credit can get you blacklisted
Instead we should say Joe Rogan makes a quarter million from Spotify and makes consequential presidential endorsements so he doesn't get to do the I'm just a stoner idiot don't listen to me act
I'm thinking live stand-up yeah
I mean yeah if you're talking live standup but that isn't really the problem imo
If clubs and producers stopped booking them
I think the approach is to treat them the way they treat mainstream press
What are you gonna exclude them from we're talking about the biggest podcasts in the world by far
Yeah itâs a real problem!!! Especially on twitter where people will retweet anything they hate to be like âthis is badâ and end up just giving people a bigger platform and help them gain an audience
They are the platforms
No we're past that point
Like people are always saying they suck but I think there probably needs to be more of an effort to not platform these kinds of people and the people that support them
And the Joe Rogans etc etc
I'm reading the antifa handbook and I'm starting to think maybe we aren't harsh enough when we talk about the kill Tony's and legions of skanks of the world
@johncrete what movie did you see
the way iâm so there
I love a beautiful birthday
exactly!
Itâs actually so important to remember that mitchell is having a bday party at schubas on this upcoming friday & weâre all invited

Whoa!

"does everyone know mitchell is having a bday party at schubas on this upcoming friday & youre all invited? ð 8-midnight, we rented the upstairs ð¤ "
yes.
You donât bring that up nearly enough
When I was Val Kilmerâs assistant he was doing a one man show and the other assistant had to be the audience plant for every show
Right now Nick Fuentes could be listening to boygenius and we'd all be at brunch
Shankland doing what Kanye couldnât
You could have instilled in him a love of music
Just audience plants
He graduated the year before I got there but I would have had him
Nick Fuentes was a student at the school I student taught at
He's been around he was on Kanye's campaign staff
And it turns out he lives in his mothers basement in berwyn
A far right dickhead made a video gloating about women losing rights
Has anyone seen the nick Fuentes stuff
Burn
My mom
Does anyone know about plants

Bail
"Dude yeah, fuck that"
"For how it is in general, i feel like it has the most touristy crowds out of the clubs"
Oof thats creepy
Theyâve asked me out line three times
Also honestly Iâm 99% sure the person that booked me only booked me because theyâre trying to sleep with me
I donât care if I bomb
I mean in the sense that management is awful
"Also, who knows, maybe it got better?"
You can't protect yourself from everything and still learn lessons
I say experience it and decide
I got booked on a show there tomorrow and Iâm trying to decide if I should bail
You guys how bad is comedy bar
You should it was an awesome idea
no worries
Anyone wanna go dancing Saturday btw??
Itâs such a fun kinda show to produce
"Hollywood, Illinois"
When I get back from Japan Iâm starting my video show again :-)
Truly she was slumming it at CrushXCrushWest
truly insane
I left a little after it bc was tired from driving but good vibes
Kinda insane how good Clareâs video was.
Suckân my own dick at midnight
it was starting to feel too much like lolla!!!
I think it's canceled because I don't think anything good is going to happen again
Just perfectly in the way
Those dumb vip booths wrecked the vibe
and also the lineup this year was lame
honestly pitchfork has gotten to be too much
In their reviews
Pitchfork is about to start using the r word
I just think that's an attempt to soften the blow
watch them move it to austin
yeah and saying âwe will not stop hosting eventsâ
I just feel like itâs so specifically like âweâre not doing it in Chicagoâ and âwe have made the difficult decision not to host Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicagoâ sounds like itâs gonna be somewhere else
Like I don't think moving it to Gary Indiana or whatever would make it more profitable
Yeah you're probably right
"I don't interpret that as ""we're going to have it somewhere else"""
I mean thereâs European pfk fests that are wayy smaller which is maybe what they mean by continue to produce events
Yeah itâs GQs faultâ¦ gays and queers!!!
"Whoa whoa whoa, letâs not go that far"
wait thatâs so gay
Man fuck GQ
Looks like it might just be moving cities which is DUMB
What!
Pitchfork fest done for good ð¢
and i just am like man maybe just close friends at lake house would be so sweetie
i feel like every year i try to either throw or go to a massive house party
FUCK ALL THEM THO
"usually we go to rebecca's parents, or my parents"
"I'll see what our plans are, but I also like this"
fine
i feel like halloween was so much shit and iâm like wait chill lakehouse holiday sounds soooo nice
anyone interested in going to wisconsin for nye?? staying at my dads vibes

My favorite part of eat pray love is when she spies on her neighbors
Klopfer you should buy a bunch of vape cartridges for 14/$100 and then resell them to your Trader Joeâs coworkers for $30 a pop

Truly one of the funniest things Iâve ever seen
Sam when you played soccer and fell only to somersault and spring back on your feet
iâm sure theyâre friends but it is truly so funny to hear geoff asmus get name dropped while iâm waiting on a line cook to drop a rueben
he keeps talking to the 25 year old food runner about âasmusâ
Hahahahahaha
hahahahaahahahahahahahaha
He played soccer with us once and he got a yellow card because he purposely slide tackled someone and in the 3 seasons Iâd played no one had even gotten carded
Hey Joey? I think this was a good riff that people didnât respect enough
"Gonna get him pregnant some day, God willing"
I love that bitch
She had been on my show like two weeks prior
One time in that side area at LF tiny was giving comics hugs next to me and I thought she said hi to me so I gave her a hug too and then she goes âare you a comic or something?â
I went to high school w a guy named Tiny Thickemz. Think heâs in real estate in West Allis now

new update he keeps making fun of tiny thickems for showing tit on stage
he wonât stop talking about laugh factory in front of all our 22 year old co workers who hate comedy
and heâs really nice but heâs embarrassing me so much
i work w collin under now
I'm out on basketball this weekend but i agree with klinger especially once it snows we should replace basketball with breakfast
I would attended a post-bball diner lunch
Folks were DUN
Last Saturday was too close to Halloween and Kristi birthday
But last Saturday I was one of three people
Everyone was talking about big game
Then it's basketball season
Is the court clear?
Ain't over til it snows
No
It's so nice out
Unfortunately it seems so
Is basketball season over
Would anyone be interested in a diner breakfast tomorrow
"I'm gonna have another Christmas party gang. Trying to decide on a date, heart this for 12/7 and thumbs up for 12/14"
And it's other funnier comedians
"If I've learned anything, it's that club owners know exactly what makes comedians funny"
LOL
CJ is popular on twitter and has some writing credits now I think
Cj is a good comic that used to live here
Jamie masada is the founder of laugh factory like above curtis
Why does anyone try to put their finger on the scale
"Also, I don't understand shit like this lol"
Who is Jamie Masada and CJ Toledano
"I guess its not great tea, but jamie masada really wants chris bader to be a thing"
"Way back in the day when cj toledano lived here, jamie masada tried to get cj to write jokes for chris"
A little tea i know about chris
Really?
I have never seen that dude show up for a spot. Heâs on so many posters and then just doesnât go
At least a once a week performer at LF
He's like the kind of dude laugh factory books CONSTANTLY
Me? Iâm more of a guy on 2 shows type of guy
Oh gotcha
"Kind of a laugh factory, Zanies, comedy bar and road guy"
"Iâve never heard of that guy, is he never? Or just like a laugh factory guy"
And he sucks so bad
Laugh Factory just throws him on everything
It's so funny that Chris Bader is on the fresh faces show me and Sam are doing next Tuesday

If anybody hasnât seen and wants to join
Okay I still havenât seen Anora so I think Iâm going to the 6:55 showing at Regal on western
I have a free laundry key so Iâm gonna wash everything I own this month for revenge

Dropped ten bucks on a laundromat bc of that little stinker
Right when I poured detergent on clothes
Landlord shut water off an hour earlier than he said he would for repairs

Whoâs going
Hell yeah!
i got the second interview!!
Communication is always good
To confirm the time?? I donât think youâve gotta
is it dumb to do a follow up 15 min before an interview
Kidding around here but pls dont let it get infectected
Do landlords know about neosporin? It's body stuff not building stuff
John this looks like you haven't put ointment on it at all
It's literally been like 4 days
It's really wild how this cut is progressing
Kilometer Tony?????
Getting word of a possible special guest at Coleâs next weekâ¦. Heâd be traveling a lot of â¦.. KILOMETERS to get there
UGH MAKE LANDLORDS GREAT AGAIN
heâs Marxist now â¤ï¸
Trump is gonna make it illegal to be mean to landlords
What I'm really worried about too with trump being elected is that mortgage rates will go up and I won't be able to refinance by May like I wanted
The cost of shit has being going up a lot
I may even have to increase rent if I can't refinance this year
Honestly probs not
danny and i wanna make a house a home
wait john will u have a spot by may :june

she lives in austin
I heard Benjie used to work for black rock
one of my coworkers had two friends who dated her
lmfao
But I know it's there to heal me
"Man, pulling a scab off is so satisfying"
Might try yoga w Adrienne now this bitch sounds cool
thats why she had to learn yoga! to stretch!
HOW DID THEY EVEN KISS????
THATS TOO TALL TO LOVE!!!!
and she dated a guy 7 feet tall
til yoga with adrienne is an alcoholic who smokes
Nice!
heâs shooting his own short!
Plester?
and i had to be like hey thatâs sick but i want actual good footage girl what r u doin
my producer is like cool but too cool and thinks we can film this on only a camcorder
iâm scared
hahahaahhaahahah
I thiiiiink I know how heâll film itâ¦begrudgingly ð
ooooo good idea
"Tbh, Derek??"
on a handheld preferably
who would yall recommend for a person to film a show
he opened up his set last night being like i lost a bet if trump won i would have ti get into ventriloquism
The last time I saw him rap at Coleâs it made me laugh so hard
does anyone have his number
He fucking rules
itâs okay when i do it
Now that Kristi is the host I realize that itâs actually a very just system
I thought the bumping at Coleâs was so unfair when I first started here
heâs getting into ventriloquism
haahahHAH i love him so much
Erik West would get vouched so hard
Three months in youâre already addicted to this bs
what is coleâs if i canât let joey walk in and do a set
all i do is bump
Erik West can be the one guy you bump in
and itâs like no bumping??
thatâs so true
I think the 6pm crowd is probably exactly the group that is monitoring the vouch shows
hahaHAHA
how will erik west find out he doesnât have a computer
But the mic was a pretty decent vibe
Well the word would spread
idk!
yeah like is it fair to throw this new format in for the people who come every week at like 6 pm and wait
Didnât mean to send that
ð
"Yeah, I will say when I did the one at Lottieâs there werenât very many Coles regulars"
i donât want to screw over our regulars
yes but just coleâs style donât be a weirdo and change our format
maybe iâll tell them yet but no lotto
yeah also i donât want to do lotto
Yeah itâs a lotto of 50 people upton
And a different sign up process I guess since I think they do lotto
Itâll just be a different 50 open micers
itâs def not gonna like help coleâs
and yeah sometimes nights at coleâs are slow but idgaf itâs mainly 50 comics every week and a really long gig
no literally i get the same paycheck so idc
Frankly all youâre signing up for is a longer night of hosting. Youâre doing him the favor
but when my friends get it thatâs fun no shade
Yeah if itâs âwe need to now nowâ then the answer is no!
and gay even
but itâs coming off not cool
ultimately i think itâs a good idea for the scene
EXACTLY
CYSK speedrun
"Going in with that attitude of ""you should be honored to be asked and don't expect me to be organized or respectful of your time"" is just replicating the rotten culture"
Idk I can see the value in something like that conceptually but it only works if you have some humility
That makes it easy imo
and he was like well no itâs important i go home tonight with an answer
"but yeah, really up to you guys"
and i was like hey you never reached out to me i need a second
"I feel like honestly there's plenty of slow nights at coles anyway, so it wouldn't hurt to make one of em for vouch"
yes
Wait this was in person?
idc that much i donât like that he was like cornering me as i was trying to set up saying âhe needed to know Nowâ
i personally donât see it at coleâs but idc too much
Will doing it at coles just alienate the audience of normal attendees that already come on a regular basis?
does coles benefit?
"My only thought on them asking to do it at coles is, why coles?"
I think that's just the only way to present it
"Even if they're fuckin dorks about it being like ""an honor"" or some shit"
"Consider the way that organizations raise money for specific causes. People always make the argument of like, ""people will donate to the cause anyway"", but I think ultimately formalizing the process and stirring up publicity results in a more accountable experience, and forces the process of bookers booking people"
"i think the purpose to get people booked is genuinely good but this process is a little redundant and a jack off, no?"
to doâ¦ other shows?
and then the show is an audition?
So thatâs how it works logistically
I did one of the mics and basically they just draw 50 people at the beginning of the mic to do 3 minutes as an audition for the show
like why doesnât chris trani just come see an open mic and ask people himself
it seems a little self important???
I do think what they're doing is a genuinely positive move for the community though
he didnât like that i didnât know him
Brandon is a sloppy person
lol
and i was like ahhhh what hahaha
and heâs like âwell we need to know Nowâ
brandon was like hey victoria hasnât responded to me so i showed up where is she and i was like sheâs in madison
they asked to do coleâs and idk if i like their vibe
ok iâll bite whatâs the deal w vouch
i donât girl iâm sorry
upper penisula

CHAOS BRINGS THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER
Feeling amazing running into John stockwell tonight in the middle of the street in front of his house because somebody was drunk driving (?) and rammed their car into a bunch of cars on his street like 15 minutes before Derek and I biked by from a late showing of smile 2 where we got way too drunk and way too scared and thought we were still in the movie a little bit
Explain
yeah basically
howâs morale
not bad tbh
Is he the new moral center of Coleâs open mic? How are the vibes there
i like christian royce now
Kristi is saving the world rn
Yeah I immediately regretted that as soon as I sent it
and this is what I come back to?
I go to Japan for TWO WEEKS
Please Ian I know times are difficult but we canât blame Japanese beetlejuice
I can't help but feel Japanese Beatlejuice shoulders some blame here
When we needed you the most you went to Super Mario World
It's a shame America can't hear poopfucker tonight
Gonna figure out the joke that will fix America on the way
Gonna head up to Coleâs in a few
Are you in touch with IWW?
In a groupchat with workers who wanna unionize but our store hasnât yet
Is there a union person you can talk to
I donât know how to explain it itâs so convoluted and fucked
The hours I needed to go towards my ada/fmla thing were cut down because I was on leave of absence for injuries
Does this make sense?
"So I was enrolled also in an ada thing (did that so I couldnât get reprimanded for looking like Iâm not having fun at work.)

That gave me two call offs a month. Those absences go towards insurance hours.

I was banking on those to go towards my insurance qualification.

Theyâre just now telling me I havenât worked enough to qualify for that kind of thing so I canât account for those absences"
Idk how fmla works but getting injured and taking a little off seems pretty obvious and standard right?
Iâm ready
Need more incentive for a change
ugh dude iâm so sorry thatâs horrible
Losing my insurance in December bc I didnât work enough bc of my injuries :-)
Put a gun range in the pergola
"Shooting a gun is like being bisexual, you really need to try it every few years just to check and see if your taste has changed and you like it now"
Shankland is political enough that I'd consider going
Same
Fucked of you to say because I do have my rifle merit badge
bc you'd be the first guy we all turn against?
"Yeah, and I'd go with him!"
Aaronâs friend isnât in the chat to be fair
Absolutely going nowhere near a gun range with anyone in this chat
i've shot rifles with my dad before
I love shooting guns
Just honked at a coworker for trying to be cutesy with me while I sit in my car for my break
ð
He has a lot of guns and good vibes
He would be down
I have a buddy who is an ex marine
anyone going to this-
That man looks like he owned guns off the record as well
"Lmao Richie's real estate developer, good fella grandfather"
Can I use this
Just found my grandpaâs gun license
"Gun bad, gun range fun"
And when you hit the little can sitting on the fence? Oh baby
Shooting a gun feels awesome tbh
No dog hate the dog is innocent!
Also I used to work for West Virginias newest senator and I canât tell you how much I hate him and his dumbass dog
"chat trip to gun range 
ð¥¹ðð"
You simply gotta try it
Itâs crazy some people in this chat havenât shot a gun
If they donât pass they get sent to vibe camp
I would have a gun in a fun Charlieâs Angels kind of way
This country needs mandatory vibe checks
You pass the vibe check for one meg
idk I think Iâd be really good at gun
cant stop telling people about it
and unfortunatley it is the funniest thing ive ever read in my life
Some liberal white guy derek went to college with posted on facebook today that he wanted to learn how to shoot a gun because he was afraid for where the country was headed but a few weeks ago posted a 3 paragraph post about how being in las vegas was over stimulating
Good news! They're sending the kid that bit me to a farm upstate with lots of space to run around with all the other kids that bit their teachers
There is still good in the world chat
Hahahaha
You think the uBreakiFix guys stole it?
All my porn is gone tho
Got my phone fixed if you couldn't tell
There should be more imo
"My own Twitter, you might say"
there are 95 people why not use it as a testing ground
A medium of my own creation
"A writing exercise, perhaps"
This chat is simply a writing utility for my twisted little jokes
don't hide your light in the bushel of this chat
"In this one, rare, instance John and I agree"
Wanna host shit for dis cute little chat
We can also lip sync budd Dwyer etc
I have an amplified podium at my apartment if anyone wants to do a weird karaoke night
Coming from the chat heretic of course you'd say that
I had strep the first time he won and now a knee injury. Feels like this is my fault for not staying healthy
Nothing is sacred
I do this on almost a daily basis
"Lol yeah, weâll see, not sure yet!"
I feel like most folks are tuned out of everything right now
I say post it if you feel like it
"In a way, the same thing"
ð
I see you as the chat grocery store owner
Iâm sort of a chat organizer
Chat is kind of the new community
Oh well then that's fine of course
But I did then use it and for that I apologize
