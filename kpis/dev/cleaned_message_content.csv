Just present it to the class by  tomorrow
Oh thanks for handling that Caroline
i literally might know how but its gonna take a day
I thought it was going to be longer tbh
I love how everyone is releasing their pictures with the Sidekicks minion from Bruceaarons karaoke party on a different day Really is making the minion feel alive
Thats science baby I think we have turned it around because the act of sending a first draft unfinished emotionally charged is a universally terrifying experience and I am willing to admit all the errors in my ways Interesting how management never ever has to admit when they are wrong If only there was a better way
summer  is gonna hit different
Congrats Matty
I need sun
This is not a good life
Sending cold emails on vyvanse for internships 
Happy birthday Matty

sorry maddie
only one maddiematty is allowed to have a good day and i used up all the good on my bday 
 sorry that happened to you Maddie
happy birthday Matty
Happy birthday matty
All good to know info It is not going well lol
Happy birthday Mattison
hahahhahahahah why is there not an undo send option i feel like outlook has or had this
Just for the future
I wish they had that setting in the chess app
Happy birthday Matty
You can change settings to like have an email sit in your outbox for however long before sending
I EXPECT MY EMAIL TO REACH THEIR INBOX THE MICROSECOND I HIT SEND
Theyre literally waiting s to send it just in case you decide to back out
Its so funny how that works
unsend
Some have a resend option if it was within secs or a min
What emailer do u use
I committed the cardinal sin of accidentally hitting send instead of draft on a very emotionallycharged unedited email about scheduling issues to my new general manager New layer of hell I cant handle
thank you I am blessed to be in a group of so many capricorns and spoiled by all ur love
Happy birthday Matty
Happy beautiful birthday to our dearest Matty

Idk if its your thing but the Harley Quinn cartoon goes so hard
Wanna know how I got these numbers
John told me that now that hes building a DIY venue in his garage hes charging his tenants a monthly  entertainment fee
rents are tied up in one warehouse and assessments are in another warehouse john only has time to raise one which one is he skating to
Some men just want to raise the worlds rent
Hes like if the joker got a cpa
Hes a financial villian
Like oh this guy is no longer a landlord
I gained respect for stockwell for trying to raise his neighbors taxes
Aooooga 
About to get struck from lightning lube 
Maybe I should try to get a kid to pull the fire alarm
The vibes at school suck so much today smdh
Benjamin Penis Oppenheimer set the nickname for Johnbo Walter Stockwell to Private Johnquity
Private johnquity
This has Stockwells name written all over it
Private equity bought the storage unit place and raised the rates 
So sorry you had to deal with all of this
At least jolly bean bring heat
Its maddening when the most toxic people arent even funny

Yeah that is crazy and unfair of her
calling me transphobic is like soooooo crazy lol
Yeah I mean I dont think its on you to take any responsibility for anything but yeah Id reach out to someone thats closer with her if you think shes really at risk
and its really scary
and im being told things i never did
and im being called transphobic

I googled it
Ohh
What is gay ass
Chicago coyotes are like cicadas they come and go in a  year long cycle
you must be in cahoots with the Quiznos Coyote
There never was no coyote and there certainly never was no coyote incident
No Never
Did anyone else hear about the coyote Quiznos incident
I cant believe I never knew there was a coyote in a Quiznos in 
Hahahaha
Huhneeded the captions
It was bizarre
He did great
Diego was handed the best possible audience he could have ever asked for
gay ass is also packed audience core such a good crowd
that show looks so fun is sully running that
Got exhausting to watch after a while
Like just justifying every shooting
And he was basically just a shooting apologist lol
I used to watch this dude on YouTube that was a former cop and he would do shooting breakdowns
Copcast
Its very Chicago
It was me a musician am artist who does the posters for the O Sees and a former cop who started a podcast
That show looks really cool
Actually pulling an audience
Dude is doing a talk show at a bar in Lincoln square
Huh
This Welcome to the Show thing is so cool
His profile says Drag Queen so its ok
Its because he does musical comedy
And its not because every single one of his jokes is homophobic
But I do not like him
Ive still never seen him
So no one has to follow him
Lmao they put Diego last in the lineup
Or rat race
What about spy kids
I wanna do this one but they wont let me
it depends on the day
Or does someone else name you
Do you guys name yourself
I havent seen it 
Kinda like this 
Trying to make some for internship
Theres this thing in sports social media where you put the logos of each time on a character
Can you guys think of any specific movie scenes that would be good for like a social media hockey post
to alienate anyone who didnt watch Very Cavallari
say you also volunteer at uncommon james
How do you guys binge drink so much
No I wish I worked at fabletics
Thats good info horby This is why you should be a bumble consultant
or minion for scale
i feel like you should make the sentence completely all caps or add in something a little more  like recently did a photo shoot with a minion
do you actually work at fabletics
My dating app bio sucks idk whats wrong w me 
Its not letting me send the promo image here
Also were officially on for Fri Feb

I couldnt handle the amount of lore in traitors

This is awful
Moderate drinking until 
New years and my birthday have been enough

My grandpa donate change the sheets
Ok fine then youre allowed to leave a shitty comment
My grandpa was a proud conservative beekeeper 
thats rly what he looks like
I reported them and instagram said those are actually fine
There have been some pretty bad ones telling me Ill get whats coming to me and sexual stuff etc
Theyre both like this is whats wrong with liberal men and actually beekeeping is for conservatives
But making fun of beekeeping is one step too far
But its funny how those two hobbies turn out to be the perfect discourse grenade
I love how these guys are probably the exact same guys who make fun of cancel culture
Idk what I was expecting youve committed the crime of being a woman on the internet
Yeah they dont hate each other as much as they hate me
I at least appreciate that there are defenders of beekeeping and mushroom growing in the IG comments
lol I didnt see the reel
Ive deleted some of the truly horrible ones
Oh its much worse on instagram

What time is best for me to eat ribs I just got delivered
anytime works for me the chive never sleeps
the highest engagement time  for instagram is noon on mondays
I have no idea i always try to google best time to post  and probably post at times that are better for branded recipe accounts
What time do u guys get most engagement for posting ur vids
Well the broncos got booty clapped by the bills as Im sure many of you were wondering
Couldnt get into it myself
The thumbs up is bc I dont want you guys yapping abt the show in here
Even the broncos player felt pretty bad about it after
Yeah that was a nasty hit man
I think that dude just got paralyzed
yes
I just caught up I need to chat
Should we have a traitors chat
Sean payton would have made a great Real Housewife in another universe tbh
Yeah Sean Payton kinda was pissing me off at first but he is elevating the shit out of this talent poor roster especially on offense He just has the players so well prepared Makes it easier to stomach when he gets all catty in the press
Its getting nasty now sorry my fault
Bills are averaging about  yards per rush though it feels like gotta clean that up
Hate ur coach love ur qb
But da broncos are legit
He refuse to lose honestly
I knew it was gonna be close like this Just worried josh allen is gonna go God mode soon

Ooh sertas
Just wanna say when they mentioned the Denver Nuggets on chapo the other day that was huge for me
 wtf
a bit
of course
Power of nightmares
Forget the name but super insightful
Also the one where he highlights the similarities between the rise of the Taliban and the neocons is excellent
Ya hyper normalization is crazy good
Also shes been on chapo lol
It was so cool when Sarah canvassed for bernie with Eric Andre ngl
and we talked about hyper normalisation w her lol
one time my ex boy chat put sarah squirm in the chat when you could still do that on twitter
Only Curtis I dont care for is the one who never books me at laugh factory
Only Curtis I didnt care for so much was the Soviet footage with no narration Hey Adam ur supposed to tell me how to feel
Anyone trying to brutalist
Is there a move tn
Did you see he made a weyes blood music video lol
I put it on to get woke but whatever
Like hes such a good editor
trauma zone was sooo good not to be gay or whatever but as an editor it is really inspiring
Just watched the one about the mall in England
Im like  min into hyper realization but I put it on to fall asleep a lot
I was watching traumazone to fall asleep
okay but if were talking mark fisher the realll question is who are the adam curtis heads in the chat 
Yeah the beauty of capitalist realism is its so short
i like to pair my mark fisher with maggie nelson
thats def something to pick up when ur unemployed lol
I wanna read the big anthology of everything that was on k punk but its like  pages lol
Its so good
Ive got a library trip coming up and im gonna get this hot book yall are talking about
I just know he propped up verso books for a year with that purchase
when I worked at cards against humanity the guy who ran it who ended up getting canceled ordered hundreds of copies of capitalist realism to give everyone for christmas but he forgot so there were just like mountains of capitalist realism stacked by the front door for anyone to take lol
hes super good at articulating things in a clear way possibly the best reading his post punk book rn
thats fucking weird behavior im sorry
she wont book claire sundbye on lesbian lodge
like yes
Adult show and tell
they have this thing against me and theyve had it since college and wont book me for mainstage and its lowkey bullllllshit
cancelling all these shows and booking ur friends who arent comedians to do powerpoint nights is not the community forward thinking u think it is
Itd be like a full show not just the record
Million percent
I listened to a podcast on Hauntology and Lost Futures but after reading this I think the book has got to be better Hes explains zizeck so well its very impressive
Wait I hope you were serious lol
Just group messaged yall on insta I think they have a form to fill out I have just messaged them in the past
borkey is morally corrupt
wait i have a lot to say about lodge bookings but at work
im huge mark fisher girl
yes
Despite being literal gaming history
Oh Because Christian Borkey emailed Guinness and said the Pokmon reading didnt sell enough tickets
That guy was not legit sorry to break bad news
Not officially recognized at sloppies
Yeah its a lung capacity challenge more than anything else
Wait Im confused did you not already accomplish this goal at World Record sloppy Sunday
So im guessing its not PokeRap style cause you gotta go so fast
Yes Can you connect me
Bruceee you should totally do that at bricktown that would be electric
Oh yeah how could I ever forget
Wait Bruce how were you going to win the Lodge a Guinness world record
Yeah not worth it
Wed probably have to know a land lord tho to have access to that sort of thing
If only there were some sort of magical garage event space with some sort of multi functional heating AND cooling unit that could be sort of the new underground diy alt comedy space
Man that sucks Jeff
We cant have you burn down the theater with  presale and no Guinness book of world records
Watch them schedule AOC and Chicago method technique at the same time
Sorry Jeff Braun  I am sorry I know this is old news now but this makes me so mad at Christian Borkey and Lincoln Lodge generic idiocy and overall desire for standup hegemony Is there another generic standup show that she knows will make them tons of money waiting in the wings Hilarious to watch the series of emails evolve over the years
Im literally like I will rent a theater I will buy all the tickets myself
call it the chill as fuck show
Lodge has ignored all my emails about a show that would immortalize them in the Guinness book of world records
What if it was a hit though
You should show them how little you care Call your show Fuck You Comedy Show or something dumb like that
he speed reads  newspapers a morning and would quiz us on  them
And I talked to Kerry about it and she was like but if you sold out presale it would have been chill
I just remembered that when Sam cut that wire at AOC Kyle was like we cant have you guys burning down the theater with  presale tickets
Also presale is stupid Just base it on actual sales
They canceled my block party show bc low presales and I tried to reschedule it like x and theyve been ignoring me lol
Im sorry Jeff Braun  Lodge has been really weird lately about fun shows
I feel like people like him read a bunch of summaries of books
I was going to say I didnt know you interned at British community College
he has the vibe of someone who cant read but probably reads more than all of us combined
i would love to see him write a book
Lmaoooooo
"oh no this is the guy to be clear

I think stand up is disappointing because most thoughtful art being destroyed is because it passes through so many hands with different agendas
Sorry for being annoying
I understand the desire to consume things that let you turn your brain off but I wish there was more space for thoughtful art in the modern world  like across the board music books film included
Going to pour one out for Mark and David Graeber tn
RIP mark Fischer 
Probably explains why like crowd work comedians the bad ones are also becoming more popular
yeah he was really good i liked him
like interrupting me in the middle of speaking to be like uhmmm uhmmm yeah uhmmm this article was about uhmmm but like he had a point
Probably the most succinct and digestible piece of theory Ive ever read
and he made fun of how nervous i got when i talked
I just got it today and am ripping through it I think its excellent
hes the guy who introduced me to the people in the office as jewish
What was he like
Oh my god thats so sick
dude i interned for mark fischer in 
I think about my brother in law who likes Andrew Schulz and all that stuff and I guess theres some kind of wish fulfillment they get from watching that kind of comedy and maybe things that differ challenge them in a way they dislike I suppose its harder to relax when what youre consuming requires attention
I think the lodge is also maybe only interested in short term and less likely to take chances than it was years ago havent they been losing a lot more money in the last few years
Or to rephrase why is alt comedy maligned rn even when weve seen it has potential to succeed within the current system
Yeah I think it probably is but its being diluted
But as the audience for comedy as a whole grows larger youd imagine the appetite for alt comedy would grow even just as a consequence of the law of large numbers
And main stream viewers want to see stuff similar to stuff that introduced them into liking comedy which is largely right leaning unfunny podcasts
Its because comedy is becoming more mainstream
Bc I dont think people really like it
There is a proliferation of normcore standup happening and I really cant figure out the cause
So true
Two most successful Lodge cast members of the last like  years are Sarah Sherman and Megan Stalter and theyve created a space that wouldnt be accepting to either of them
Because the people who run these things think less of what they perceive as alt comedy
I feel like a lot of standup I see in nyc is homogenized
Idk why comedy as a whole has become so resistant to experimentation
Truly upsetting jokes aside that is annoying
Comedians You Should Know 
Should have named the show Chicago Hot Dog
Marry fuck Tony
Man this fucking blows sorry Jeff Braun
What if you changed the name to koll tiny
Beg for one more chance and let me buy every presale ticket for February
Its on my list
Chicago method technique that WILL get you LAID
Thatll catch some eyes
What about the free money Chicago method technique
Have you considered calling it roast battle
Maybe Hillarious and a picture of Rodham Clinton in there somewhere
Christmas we share
If I find a spade You get custody on fridays I get saturdays
Chicago method technique hilarious
Maybe throw a hilarious in the title
I have an awesome projector and am searching for smallmedium rooms in spaces that are hungry for alt comedy
It kind of kills the point of a theater of independently produced show if you want everything to basically be branded the same as the laugh factory
The ironic part is the room was packed last night with walk ups and comps
reply with actually friday works for me and my show Only Fomedy actually
Send him this with dollar signs and question marks
Maybe see what she thinks about this
Your art and show name is driving away the kill Tony demographic
post this as a promo
So stupid
That kinda art attracts the right crowd for that kinda show
What a little bitch
Oh my god

Can we please remember not everyone is caught up on traitors
adrienne youve done such a good job
 percent agree
Also people underestimate bachelorbachelorette because they dont realize thats also a highly strategic social game
They always think theyre smarter than they are
Anyway big brother players are sub par
Once Lisa Barlow is on traitors its going to win an Emmy
I feel like this was said earlier in chat
and it was
Henrys gotta take a break for that one
I was just stanning my girl dorinda
I knew better
see
Well I didnt know about this
The traitors picked the obvious choice and Carolyn was saying it from the start
The Dorinda choice was a bad one
Ultimate respect 
Dorinda could drink me under the table
I spit
When she was like ohhh theyre sorry for getting less money just to make us more of a target
THE HOUSEWIVES ARE SOOOOOO DUMB
Dorinda aside
Dorinda ruled
Keep Dorindas name out of your mouth
I said wouldnt it be hilarious
Henry told dmed me on the side and asked me to say that
I bet Robyn turns it up if she doesnt get murdered immediately
Its gonna make me question why you left your job at the haberdashery
Its so funny
Its really wild how dumd so many of the housewives are
Hey brother if your not cumming in caps
Tonya is the best anti hero though
Tonka should be in Florida with his family
Bob the Drag Queen is my favorite this season
Yeah I was kidding
wait that was good
It scared me
I dont know why cumming was in caps
take away the emphasis I remove my like
I love Alan CUMMIMG
He made Tonya give up Tonka
On Alan cumming
Youre making Joey say slurs
Just give Alan his flowers
Henry theres no point in doubling down
Stolen valor
I think Alan Cumming is getting credit for his outfits that I think the production team is designing
anyways Im off to the lincoln lodge
Henrys not homophobic he just hates faggots
Ho Mo Phauxbic could be a good drag name
Excited to see her reaction
Gabby might find the smoking gun next episode
Sounding more homophobic by the minute
Yeah homophobes dont make sense
heres what i love gabby windey being the literal bachelorette and now not only being a lesbian but also seriously dating a standup comedian i find her perfect  i hope she wins
Yes
I dont think thats fair I think bob the drag queen is the best character on the show
Australia season two was terrible
And yes I HAVE seen the international versions
Alan Cumming is being so cunty and gay and not liking that is homophobic
mitchies there  he made it sound star studded
shut the fuck uppppppo
Is it an electrifying vibe at Gods Lincoln Lodge tn
if i made a real life traitors game could we play it at the garage Johnbo Walter Stockwell

Maybe Ian is a traitor 
Its weird having Ian side with me

Spinoff host trying to stand out energy
Cmon
This something or other is iconic
Andrea maybe
You cant call her iconic if you idk her
Yeah but I bet everyone in the uk does
Alan is pushing too hard
You dont even know her name
Idk the UK woman but I can tell shes an icon
But youre just plain wrong here unfortunately
I appreciate you sticking up for the below the line hosts of the international seasons
And he was good in spy kids
The Alan cumming role being iconic is erasure for the other international seasons that came before US and I wont stand for it
And so many people biffed it
They had to run across floating platforms late in the game
And that was redeeming
Jesus Christ never come to my workshop again
Like pure laughter
Season two though he was laughing so hard during one of the challenges
Sorry youre wrong
Wrong
I also think Alan cumming is annoying
i wanna be alan

I dont cosign that statement
See you gotta drop the requirement of watching together
Dylan efron is proving to be the cleverest efron
All the traitors in one room strategizing is such bad play
were only one ep in
The cliffhanger of the third ep is eating me alive
this is zac efrons brother erasure
I bet they do on YouTube
Someone should make a cut that excluded any mention of who is a traitor
I feel like voting him out or murdering him is just a waste of time so he will go far
Too much exposition
Truly the most secure spot as a player
Honestly a great place to be for n
Chrishell from selling sunset has ROASTED him a few times already
I think hes taken the role of too dumb to be a traitor but too unlikeable to strategize with
Its awesome that hes famous
Hes one of the dumbest people on the planet
I need him to last till the end
Sandoval is the best of us
Sandoval and Britney Spears weird ex
Have to say that the straight white guy delegation did not send their best this season
""
Just to piss us off maybe
Why hide that from the viewer
I feel like they would have said that in the rules
Im guessing they werent allowed to say which number of doors from the left they were
Yo the way theyre playing the door game is pissing me off
Tell her to send me pics anytime her dog shits
Give her my number
Did dog eat a burger
It looks like a burger patty
Hahahahahahahaha
my mom sending me pics of my  year old dogs diahreaheh
the eyes are so weird looking and the skin is too smooth
why do they have a weird ai filter on all the confessionals
SHE LOVES TOO HARD
Im a huge Ayan fan
The monster is throwing the shoe not shoe at monster
Sort of a reverse alZaidi situation Im afraid
Who is he Muntadhar alZaidi
Was it with Kayley Horton
Caroline
Hes not even funny
And the faithful really fuck over someone at the end imo
But also season  is kind of bad the traitors make enormous mistakes
She has the street smarts of a career addict not to be brushed aside
She gets bullied by the nuero typical
Same thing happened to her in survivor
But shes high intelligent
Everyone underestimates Carolyn
I agree
""
""
Which season
Absolute idiots
Huge mistake
Ok yup it was who I thought
Wait sorry I dont know yet
Need to talk bout dis
First murder was a mistake
Joe Kilgallon cheated on his wife then got really drunk and threw a shoe at lodge and they gave him a gazzelie for it
Just wondering why you didnt change it
Traitors rocks
Need a daily summary
Can I get the short and dirty of it all
The chat going crazy today what is going on
Why are we all harping on this
So its like
I already spelled it sow
Im trying to teach Andrew to respect women
Ok thats kind of what I thought ty
Kerry covered that with her joke I think
Sorry
Isnt it spelled sew
You guys could hit a couple open mics together or whatever
No I got my lovely gf a sowing machine for Christmas and she is also learning to sow
Klinger my fist will give you a free alteration to your Face if you try to do that
hit you up you mean ask for free alterations 
who are you going to hit up about reaping
Matty Merritt Im going to hit you up about sowing later
Theres no set johnversation volume bc any johnversation will expand to fill up any room or container its confined to
But thats neither here nor there
Not a normal johnversation volume
Which is like a normal conversation volume
Honestly Ive been blasting music in there and the loudest it gets outside is like  decibels
You cant even tell its the ac thumping on the roof when it starts spinning up
How sound proof is ur garage
I got it to heat the garage and wouldnt you know its too cold for it to heat the garage
look at this puppy
INSTALLING
Youre just taking away the crucial part of stand up
Or a monologue or a play
Well they have these its called a one person show
how did we know this info from the gazelllies do we have someone representing us from the inside
were holding vouch up my ass hop in
I heard the crushes auditions are at laugh factory this year
SORRY LAUGH FACTORY
gonna start a rumor the netflix auditions are happening at crushes
I think so
Not when theres real housewives to watch
cant wait to hear about the trip
Both of those guys are way more talented and better than Ill ever be but i just cant get into their comedy at all for that reason
is this the netflix is a joke thing
Jerrod is one of my favorites The perfect amount of self indulgent
I think drew michaels and Jerrod Carmichael too self indulgent on stage but not untalented
also im post covid comedy
I think it would make better lineups than cysk
"like why would
i know that guy"
well i think the whole thing is im a gen z girl
i feel like i just learned about the concept of absolutely not liking someone and liking their stand up
Make a new cysk called comedians Kristi has heard about
I think I would love his standup if he was like  percent less up his own ass
No way to know unfortunately John was fixing his ac
Im back in town Did I win a Gazzellie
He did a residency at the lodge a couple years ago and I kinda liked him despite all of the bad things Ive heard
Speaks to his talent that he is successful when it is incredibly rare to meet a comedian that doesnt hate him
Not to be a contrarian drew michael type but i like drew michaels standup
And then they make it and its like oh yeah standup looks insane when theres no one laughing
Theyre like why is no one doing this
All Im sayin is that someone has the idea to film a standup special w no audience every five years or so
the joke was about killing myself
I took Kevin bozemans class in  and he came to give feedback and he liked one of my jokes
 sorry
Five words for you buddy
Cameron Gillette has more info
I remember when the HBO one came out he was on You Made it Weird I was a different guy then and Pete being so impressed and talking about how good the suicide joke was that it never had a punchline haha
Every story Ive heard of him is so incredibly mean lmao Cam is in love with him though
The thoughts do start get weird after a while though hes not wrong
When I moved to New York I told my landlord I was a comedian and she was like Drew Michael lived here before you
I like his Comedy Central half hour quite a bit but I absolutely hate those HBO special so much
Hed hate that someone is asking that so much
Hes the guy we would be talking about if this groupchat were set in 
Maria bamford did it better
Lmao
who drew michael
Lol was this entire special in front of noone
Kilgallon got into fight with Drew Michael so I actually take back everything I said
God Drew Michael once showed up at wet cash and did like  after the booked headliner
""
Why
Also Drew Michael tried to sue them so thats probably why
Danny is a good guy leave him out of this
Haha I can see Dan Kallas address on the trademark registration
cant wait to go home and watch the hangover with danny tonight
dont show up to CYSK tomorrow
haHAHAHA
Im gonna get hammered at lodge tonight and tell people that theyll never do AoC
"thats actually really good 
she says matter of factly as if granting you permission on behalf of her gender to entertain your little idea"
It would piss off Dan kallis so much
Hahahaha that would actually be so funny funny to do this
Tbh I think youll hate it
Jokers you should know
JYSK AUDITION SHOW AT THE GARAGE FOR AoC
Crushes audition show
may the fours be with you 
Yeahyeah thats sounds about right
Opened with rape jokes
omg what did he say
But outside of that I heard it was a good time
I stg the shit yall read
And guess what  he said a bunch of evil things and upset everyone
Also  the drama from the gazelles last night was that they had known monster Junior Stopka close it out
PreCOVID CYSK was unreal
No more AC installs
I am reliable I promise Ill get my act together
its awesome
awesome development at work my coworker broke up with his  year relationship and keeps asking to hold my hand
I dream of another show hosting huge auditions like that
Thanks manI needed this 
Precovid it was the hottest comedy room Id ever seen All the audition shows I did were like doing standup on easy mode
Scared the cats
Man this got a big laugh out of me
Its amazing
It seems like it was a really cool show
hahahaahahahahaha
At that point you gotta introduce him as JoeDaComic
They had a run where they were the coolest show when bar shows were the coolest thing and everything wasnt at  clubs and i like the show because im old and sentimental about it but its funny when they expect new comics to care when its as hit or miss as its been
and then chris trani was next in the lineup and i gotta say absolutely delightful
and then wouldnt really respond back to me
he was mad i didnt know him and asked his last name
he was really rude to me hosting laugh factory
Damn thats rough
Hahahahahaha
yeah we heard
Cysk was comically bad when I did it Everyone ate shit until I went up and yeah I cooked
Kristi and Joey please do this for chrushes but to people at cafe mustache
So funny to be in your s and have three kids and then yell at some  year old open micer that they wont do your bar show
In which case uh oh
Unless people like it here
Nooooooo not currently great show CYSK
My favorite part of that lodge story is that he walked up to random tables and told the people sitting at them that theyd never do CYSK
Yeah hes an asshole
Hes being a real shit head i would say
He got scary yelling at kayley to shut the fuck up at lodge
Hey guys I was away from the chat for a sec were all still fans of my favorite standup Joe Kilgallon right
oh shit is that a good book i just found her wild ig
He has wild entitlement
Thats what I learned from reading All Fours
Meanwhile its almost always ok for a woman to have an affair
Just doing standup comedy alone gives her the right to he cruel to him
He has three kids with his wife who is a nurse
Esp with a kid due at the time Jesus christ
Hes the piece of shit
No shade to Kayley the guy is a grown ass man and should know better imo
No judgement on her regardless of whats happening
probably
Theres an online test called is my wife mean enough for me to cheat on her
If not true I feel bad for Kayley she could just be collateral damage
They call it the comedy vault because thats where the best scene secrets are stored
Its okay to cheat on your wife but only if shes mean enough
What happens at Zanies Rosemont stays at Zanies Rosemont
But Im very good at making inferences
And I trust my sources
Someone saw him and his affair partner making out in the burbs
Or like Im reading between the lines of Kayley Hortons standup and his podcast
He wouldnt stop pressing for it
I can always count on you two to ingest all the local content
Ive heard that its been confirmed
Just got A flashback when my mom died I told my rabbi I was too sad to do comedy and he kept insisting I host a roast of him
Yes It was covered on his and Jonahs podcast real heads know
I just seemed likely
Was cheating on his wife certified gossip
I heard he was complaining about his wife being mean to him and its like  I wonder why
Good to know Im having a better time in New York than he is in Chicago lol
But here we are
Never thought I would have more respect for him as a comic than as a man
Has a daughter cheats on his wife gets banned from the Lincoln Lodge trying to speed run getting blacklisted
Dude the Joe Kilgallon arch this year has been unparalleled
People love awards season
Im looking at the pictures and Im like wait why was everyone there
I wasnt there but i had people on the inside
Wait I just noticed the shoe in the picture
Yes
Is that what his award was for
I for one wouldnt be celebrating getting so drunk at lodge that I threw my shoe at the window two weeks after my wife just gave birth but I guess thats just me
this line is a nod to the famous chat crossword
the first verse is about being a landlord

Meredith rocks
YOU ARE DISGUSTING

Hahahahaha that ruled
The freak out about recording in the sprinter van which is already being recorded anyways 
Keep logan weird 
ohhh my god i just saw some guy eat shit on a lime scooter at the intersection of belden and st louis 
they were like wuuuut the fuck
i did see them go to milwaukee that was awesome
The salt lake housewives always bring their a game
She also gets Bat Mizvahd this season
waiiiit chrishell on traitors is awesome too
i love meredith
ok making it a point to catch up this weekend
Yes
wait r u talking about salt lake
So very excited to see Dorinda
Shes been plowing through rh nyc
It was absolutely electric
I watched the end of this episode with Maggie its nuts
Tom Sandoval is providing so many laughs on accident this season
Meredith accused one of the girls of bugging her room
Which is the mark of a great season
Been screaming at our tv more than usual
Ive been loving this season
I would say you dont have to but you really should bc it is really fun
and alienating people who havent seen it 
i love going to a party and finding someone else talking about a reality show 
something to look forward to 
i have really fallen off salt lake this season
You dont need any background at all very fun for  people who arent even into reality tv
I love the thrill of watching a weekly reality tv show it still does it for me
i fear i am gonna get into traitors this season too maddie
also gabby windy
Wow Tom Sandoval and Dorinda and a random old Mountbatten ass royal on the traitors apparently is it the kind of thing where you need to have watched before to appreciate it
I think Joey is going Tuesday and Lucia and I talked about going Thursday
They are a different breed
Thats true
The average American mind cannot handle meeting a real housewife in person
I didnt like having the civilians in the American traitors because they were just way too trusting
The British version does civilians which i do think is more compelling but less entertaining in a way
This one has a lot of fun survivor players too
I know Adrienne Stout is into it lots of housewives
Absolutely love that show
Gibbs start tonight
Havent seen the new season but as someone who doesnt care for reality tv too much this is as good as it gets for me
Ya its basically just mafia but everyone is like a v good reality tv person
Wait this is like if Among Us was a TV show
I do still have a ticket for Sunday afternoon if you or anyone wants
I actually had to switch to today Its intermission rn
Is anyone watching the traitors new season just premiered it rules
Is it just me or is Cindy kind of BAD
cindy you are BAD

Im messing with propane heaters still
its effective heating range is like  to 
IM SO ANNOYED
THE MINI SPLIT DOESNT HEAT VERY WELL IN VERY COLD TEMPERATURES
Think of how many high powered business deals can happen in that span of time
Thats ten New York minutes though
Yet some people cant be bothered to pay the fare smh
Its crazy like maybe a train will be  minutes late but thats it and people just lose it haha
Yeah dude the MTA runs like a machine People in New York were always shocked when I would be like you have no idea how great this is
People in nyc love to complain about the trains and its like lol you mfers have never waited  min for the western blue line in the dead of winter
Im seeing him at schubas in the wild for the first time ever
Werent him and zako like fighting or something
What was the drama with Greg bartusiak a while ago
I thought someone recited Ians poop fucker joke too close to a dry tree and the joke was too fire
Damn that was the last gazellies too
Im gonna do this I think
At least you supported them financially
You can have a best tenant award
Hahahahahahahaha
IM SO SORRY
You gotta host the johnzellies in the garage
I was counting on you to livestream them
Im going to schubas
I WAS INSTALLING MY AC
FUUUUUCK
Hahahahahahahaha
I missed them
Hahahahahahaha wait the Gazellies are definitely over
I think its maybe just a good reflection of the effects of prolonged lack of investment of resources in infrastructure and public goods combined with climate change stuff
Lol Im running late
I want Gazellies updates
I dont personally understand how there are so many different separate fires at the same time in separate spots like are they all connected or if it is that easy of phenomenon right now due to the Santa Ana wings so it is truly happening everywhere with big vegetation
My brother said the same thing that they think the winds were strong enough to blow transformer and spread the spark Also there had been two years of wet winters creating an abundance of growth that was all super dry at this point from  month drought Transformers blew in my brothers area so they are still without power but no fire
Wait until theyre over and then pop off I think
It is funny but maybe
Yeah my brother lives in North Hollywood and says the winds are insane I think at some point the air gets so hot that any existing fire spreads super easily
makes sense its so so scary
But Im assuming events like that are springing up all over and the winds are just spreading to too fast
Is it insensitive to make a video where I show how tired I am after sucking all the LA firefighters dicks
And oxygenating them
And the wind has been blowing the fire to a ton of other places
And the sparks caused a fire bc everything is so dry
A friend who lives in Santa monica said winds ripped part of a roof off a building and hit a transformer or something
I think in some places up to mph
And there have been lots of winds gusting all over
Not sure of the exact cause but it is so unbelievably dry out there
is it like wind and heat combo
ok my dumb question is im confused how the fires are starting
" Pennsylvania Ave NW
Washington DC "

has anyone else watched the most recent season of the ultimatum
ill lyk in an hour lmao
oh for sure
Or rather I think there was enough writing on the wall with the election that youd have to be truly insane to say something really stupid without thinking about it
Unfortunately I feel like there will be enough hollow brained open micers who will think the the fires are abstract enough to be on the table
tbh the night after trump won nobody said anything bad hoping for the best

Really pretty sunset if you can snag a view right now
Lets do an interview anyway and see if youre a good fit 
idk if I can take on another stayathome life partner at this time 
Joey if you get an interview with john i can be a reference
and so joey is sort of the no nonsense brass tacks sort of fellow while john is always making random additions to the property and mucking things up with his goofiest newest invention
well john could pay joey minimum wage he needs to pay rent and stuff but john could still turn a profit while doing less work
Could make money on that I assume
id watch that
Joey and John as this generations odd couple would be a lot of fun
Joey would you want to manage Johns property for him

I did see a maybe stupid LinkedIn hack so that you can see jobs that were posted like  minutes ago so you can apply early Idk if that is helpful at all
God bless you
I cant believe you didnt quit the day after trump got elected and your boss was singing three little birds to the whole office
I sincerely wish they had just fired me
Im sorry Joey
I cuss out the very nature of this company once a day and thats with a very minimal workload
Im not about to start working hard for this company
my manager quit at Same Day
Did this happen at same day
Why does this keep happening to you
he has seniority over me and they just kind of expect me to take on all the work load Mr Hanley will learn to regret which of the customer service fellas they fired
theyre firing my coworker tomorrow which is such bullshit that I wont be coming into the office again and am looking for a new job asap

I look for groups of things that really to each other and then pretty quickly realize that there is usually another thing that could fit into that group so then I stash that for later and look for a different group and when I confidently have two clear groups I make the first guess etc
Hahahahahaha I truly thought it was obvious I would never use a weird photo of myself with the word accepted above my head
I dont get why people fell for it Sam is too cool to do something lame like that
 year olds only do that when theyre really scared
dude I hate seeing my friends apply to grad school
sams has a concussion every  weeks how would he have the time to apply to iowa

While you dawdled with sudoku I was expanding my glutes 

While you pondered the crossword I carved my calves

So I start looking for connections that use those words in different ways
Im living vicariously through my friends solving the connections puzzle
Like this one from November Im like too many of these are making me think of Mario which makes me think its NOT that
These are all things that remind me of my estranged father

What this is
its lit
and ask them questions about this shit
I found out I can just do the property tax appeal through them
Also I pay like  a month for a benefit with my work that basically gives me legal representation for free
these fuckers have no idea what theyre dealing with
Im a prophet

ask her to do a shot with you
did you hit that oil
Getting my oil sample at coatco
Some of them are listed as having an unfinished basement and then simultaneously have a basement apartment listed on like apartmentscom
ur single handedly taking down fishman i like it
And its not like these are some down on their luck elderly people who arent making good money anymore These are all multiunit buildings without seniorexclusions that arent listed as having a garage or a finished basement when all of them do
not all of it but some obvi
 a month thats my BEER money
these people have too much money on their hands
thats actually good can u get some of my neighbors on the other side of kimball i just got strong armed into signing up for composting
fuck you youre gonna be a good neighbor
Honestly exactly
in a way youre forcing community
So Im basically paying more than some of my neighbors when by all appearances they should really be paying much more
Yes exactly
oh and like others pay more
So if a property is assessed at a lower value than another property they pay less in taxes
Every township in chicago is basically given a chunk of the city budget that their taxes are responsible for paying Each individual property in that township is then assessed at a specific value to determine the individual amount for which that property is responsible to pay which is their property tax
i just genuinely am curious
no shade
like narcing on ur neighbors
wait but actually what do you get out of it haha
its absurd
They just get to pay less in taxes
if they dont report to the system that theyve added a garage or finished the basement theres no repercussions
Hes literally raising the rents on other landlords
and it relies on property owners self reporting when there are changes in the characteristics of the properties
Hes a landlords landlord
Like they use an automated data model to estimate the value of all the properties
In all genuineness its kindof bullshit how the property tax system is setup
Just when we thought you couldnt get any more likeable
blood will flow in the streets
Im declaring war on Logan Square
Currently working on finding out how to submit property characteristic errors to the assessors office so my neighbors pay more in taxes

It doesnt make sense in other venues
Can I do a bit where I kill myself by leaving the car running with a garden hose
I HAVE VACUUMED UP ANY AND ALL DUST IT DOES NOT EXIST IN THIS SPACE
My only thought is maybe did we consider the dust
The brick wall looks great
I did some estimating and it seats about 
Garage is pretty much good to go baby
My shift was lowkey not goated
til theyre done
i guess dont tell people the ideas u care about
like its def been done before but yeah it feels too close to home and weird timing
of someone else to do it first
yeah thats a unique idea and definitely not cool
That sucks tho Im sorry
Sounds like she just had some smoke and mirrors deflection move
i like did in a way yeah idk i feel weird and annoyed
its like too late now but normal to be seething
oh yeah i think u should have said something then
and i was like hey and she said that weird thing about how its different
like  weeks ago
idk i guess drag queens are just used to stealing ideas tho lol
when did you find out
i feel like its tooo late like shes doing it tonight and probs rented the uhaul already
like why not
i think u should actually tell her its not cool with you
this is worse than immediately after i started comedy every single comedian started joking about dating
Jk not drama just undeniable inspiration I feel like But also anything goes I spose
truthfully im gonna be a bit annoyed bc i feel like im gonna see like  insta stories being like neutral gena is a genius
Thats like real housewives style comedienne drama
I think thats pretty crazy
and i was like 
and she was like no what im doing is marketing what ur doing is art
Roadkill presents labyrinth
she like told me in the office shes doing it and i was like woah whered u get that idea
im having a headliner in westys
Or see if u can find a place with a bunch of storage lockers and set up diff comics in them
You should drive the you haul to a storage locker and have the headliner in there
i was like gonna film my special in summer and have her open for me
I had an idea recently for road kill
anyway you all are invited to my show in a the moving guys truck
Yeah thats a little too close to home if u ask me
i would ask her
idk im not the first one to do a show in a uhaul
i mean ive had the roadkill idea for like two years almost at this point and have been talking to her about it forever
its like theyre doing a grand entrance in a uhaul
Id feel weird Is the show happening in the uhaul and have they ever talked about it before
i dont own the idea but i guess shes like going around the office saying she thought of it before me
should i feel weird that netural gena is like renting a uhaul for her show tn at boots
thats a really good one
more road head and go worldwide

Got my rental laptop returned to Costco
Damn everyones getting punched on the bus except me 
I deserved it though I was on my way to Second City
some kids did that to me on the bus a couple years ago
you didnt give me time to guess
Throat bite

When you immediately resort to wrenching their balls off and biting their stomach its over
See so many people assume youre fighting on fair playing field
Are you kidding me
I will HAPPILY bite another man
thats how you reeeeaaallly get em
Its all about biting
But I was sitting down too pretty stuck
Hmm Id think twice maybe
Id say at least
Or bigger
Was he John sized
Id kick a dude in the face like a horse
I was facing forward in a seat and he came from behind I didnt know it was happening or else I would have But he was huge Im not fucking around with that
Like a fucking donkey
Id start kicking so fast
Honestly so many people feel obligated to use their hands in a fight but buddy on a bus your hands are for elevated your legs to kick people in the face
Let me be the first to say happy new year
Hahahahahaha
I was listening to ABBA
No he got off and when I left I went to the bus driver and was like I dont know if this matters but a guy punched me Ok have a good day
Hahahaha imagining you on the phone on the bus just immediately after getting punched calling the cops and explaining the situation while making eye contact is really funny
Did you call the cops or anything
Hahahahaha
And you know what Selfishly I wish he stayed in
He was big and just got out of jail which he yelled
Gotta be the bus alpha
Bus Beta
It would be funny if you and me went clubbing
And can I say Cheugy
Some guy starting yelling about someone touching women and I was in a single seat with no one in front of me and then he punched me
Me
Guys guess who got punched in the back of the head on the bus yesterday

I MIGHT just buy
but if you know them and know theyre chill and wanna chitchat  then you should ask
""
It only hit me later like oh I should have said something
when im crying at work the last thing i want is someone to ask me if im ok personally
I remember I came home once in college to my female roommate crying on the balcony by the front door said hey made eye contact and just kind of awkwardly was like oh And continued inside hahahahaha

This and the Bob Keen comment that Caroline posted are really the main highlights
all the comments are i have also been told to quit or who sent this
Also jumping into say Mike brought me to a Wisconsin gig to bully me lol
Through fb
Working cant scroll
Am I missing anything from today
Can you guys send screenshots of everything
Which was an incredible run

gena does for sure
Somebodys gotta have the pic of the blood
He had like eight drinks went outside and faceplanted

And the sidewalk outside Lincoln lodge
Looking forward to seeing this develop
So far I know Bob Keens personal axis of evil includes Mike OKeefe and the Coles managers
i wish i dated more creeps when i was  could have been so awesome
Now he seems awesome
without a doubt
He wants to be the guy to date  year olds
Honestly thats probably why OKeefe sent that 
i hate that
TJ has been nothing but nice to me personally but every time Ive had a conversation with him  he opens with so Im dating a couple of  year olds
Bob keen going there
the algorithm is aware
lmao
that being said TJ has been on are we dating the same guy in a major way
Ive barely interacted with him but heard a half dozen stories about him assaulting someone
i wasnt really around for the okeeefe era but it seemed crazy
Many such cases
Just bottled up resentment over not reaching the heights you have known you were destined for since you were  or whatever
It will only fuel the fire of the bad open micer
But he wasnt wrong about his act
Especially if youre Mike O Keefe
Im against sending that type of  to anyone out of principle
Whereas Mike sees himself as a true journeyman of the craft and TJ as an interloper hence the rage
Hes terrible
Wait who sent the text
Ive only been universally praised for my comedy which is why I do it so infrequently
guys this happens to everyone right
his online behavior is odd
guys right
I think hes probably fine but moreso knows a lot of people and gets them to go to his shows
its a badge of honor
happened to me after every show its part of the evolution
we should all post our screenshots of bookers who told us to quit in solidarity
Like was Mike right to send that to him lol
We talked a bit about this yesterday but I am curious if TJ is any good at comedy
this is awesome

My hope was to refinance this year but now that Trump is in office long term interest rates are going up
Im not gonna increase rent this year but like fuuuuuuck
But the bank increased my mortgage soon after that by about  which put me in an even less comfortable position
I had to increase them when I bought the property so theyd actually cover a reasonable amount of the mortgage And even then we were paying a bunch on top to make the mortgage
But it would put me in a position where I definitely wouldnt need to increase them for a long while
Yeah totally not saying rents would necessarily decrease
I have this print setup that makes a lot of imperfections in the gobo Im projecting on the wall and it looks super sick
Look at how sick this gobo looks that I made to project onto the garage
Yeah landlords are always getting tax breaks and passing that on to their renters

The one that got away 
Haha who is this
Should I request
say theyre just trying to get more money out of you everyone will gasp
Im requesting an inperson hearing Im gonna go hard
I cant help but feel like this location specifically is a political thing
show them this
Theres one property near me that is worth like M that one that sold in  and its been assessed at K
Im like feeling motivated to gather more broad data on this like this is pissing me off so much
ill clear this up
cc me
its based on value
yeah you should be right actually its not based on sale price in illinois
Im paying  in taxes
And thats the other thing a property that sold a month before mine is paying  in taxes based on its sale price
I shouldnt be penalized for buying a property in the area more recently than a bunch of other people in the area
Theyre assessing the values of all these properties at  of the value of my own home when the assessed value on public realestate listings are all between  the value of mine
yeah that sucks idk i unfortunately have heard the sale price holds a lot of weight with these things but im no expert
I wouldnt have an issue with it if they didnt also assess the value of all the properties in the area
Sure and thats a fair way to assess a propertys value
i think what theyre saying is its based on the sale price which idk if thats true or not but that sounds like what theyre saying
just like public documentation showing what it looks like inside etc
Or similar
But they all either have public rental listings
None of these comparable properties have been sold in the past  years except  that sold a month before mine and  that sold in 
They have a tool that you can actually really easily find comparable properties to your own And its based on proximity age size and classification So like comparable would be basically any property within a certain distance with very similar characteristics
like when you say comparable you mean they sold for a similar price
comparable as in their recent selling price
Thats how this works
Or I should be paying less
OK so if thats the case all of these other places should be paying more
I gave the property tax appeals office this very thorough property tax appeal that cites multiple comparable properties that are all paying about  of the property taxes Im paying And they denied my appeal by saying yeah but your property sold for this amount recently
wait what happened
This property assessment thing is really pissing me off
I mightve gone to the wrong one

I think its funny but I also think nobody will know its a joke haha
Sorry guys I thought it was funny but maybe Ive been smoking too much weed lately
thought you all might could use a laugh
i just saw a tweet say their mom called this a spinning sharon or something sort of humorsome
Maybe theyre a cover band 
Ask if they play any songs by Slipknot
hanging out w mastodon still dont know who these guys are
this was literally the mosh pit
Watching Texas cheerleader murder plot rn
Is there an activity tn
Dude I wanna skip in the mosh pit that sounds fun
I want to diy a g force astronaut training rig
What do you mean by skipping
Also Aarons bringing his baby and he said we could put him on the lazy Susan and spin him around really fast just to see what happens
Lemme guess Theyre all bald too 
am i crazy
like its just the phylzzz crew the band over is next to them but like i feel like saying the mosh was skipping is soooo valid
APOLOGIZE TO HIM
ok but back to this im so annoyed that it felt like i crossed the line
who cares
the mastodon guy just drank an NA beer w me
smdh
its just the phylzzz green room
Just telling them theyre pussies
yeah but they have their separate green room
Lol ur in the mastadon green room
it wasnt even about that band it was about the band after them
But I think everyone can afford to be a lil silly
I cant speak to how bands treat  view their cultural touchstones
im not crazy right thats not crossing the line thats just like funny
and the room got really tense
i think i pissed off the green room bc i mentioned that the mosh pit was skipping instead of moshing
another poll

How would that move the needle
QXY rules though if the boys want soup dumplings and phenomenal service
What if I said I want triple crown
Im feeling kind of sick right now probably not gonna make it to lunch brunch
Maddie your contributions are always incredibly insightful and always appreciated
QXY is not big round lazy Susan style tables its two tops and four top style but I have seen them pushed together to make six never  thats my contribution to the boys brunch
Some of Tims closest friends think that he is other bald Logan square dudes in a public setting

"This is a deep sickness that I have but sometimes I listen to podcast from Chicago comedians to make myself mad

And I listened to Aaron chases podcast where he interviewed Mar McFly and he made up some story about how he had a threesome with two lesbians on a beach"

never met him but i know he was shitty to victoria
One time he tried to roast me after the roast show and I said you have to say hello first and he got weird
hahahahahaha

You set your nickname to busy
Eric Sony and Hypnosis set the nickname for Andrew Shankland to Mr Android

today
due to the meeting
so if i dont respond dont take it personally on account of im just busy
just a heads up everyone today im gonna be super busy cause i have a meeting at  and am gonna be thinking about it before and reflecting on it after
i always read it as short for twink
Kids at school are calling me mr Android because of my busted ass phone
Gonna start saying this to my cat
Chicago sky player kamilla Cardoso is playing in China and this is a quote from her coach lol
Its also the title of a Beatles song
which is like so dont come to school tomorrow vibes
and its tomorrow never knows
but then i looked up what tnk stood for
just got asked to open for parkers show at the TNK fest
Sargon of Akkad
Theres only one TRUE king of the world
WTF
Nobodys here except Kristi
You wont believe how sober everyone was
Yall will never believe how great it went
IM GONNA SHOW OFF MY NEW POLO SHIRT

Me and Rebecca exchanged Christmas gifts
SHOULD I COME TO COLES STIL
Sounds like you just got a condo on Live Your Life Boulevard

rovaughn hill just stole my vodka soda
On the corner of KMS avenue and the boulevard of broken dreams
Im gonna go to Coles around  and have the best set of my life
wow this set at lf just made me go on kms ave
Who goin Coles
Ill be there running around like a gopher for the social media team lol
It was a funny joke that wouldve aged just really perfectly but I wasnt sure if this was a situation where maybe you werent wanting that sort of joke so I decided Ill just keep it to myself
Pinball sounds cool
Where
I cant Im going to a pinball convention that day
Why you delete
Anyone want to go to a Chicago wolves game on Jan 
Its mono red aggro
Might delete it
Anyone want me to do this for their linkdn
Gonna keep it
Hmmmmm
Unless the dating meta has shifted
Might come off as a little too strong
Id say maybe
Hard to say
Is this too much for hinge
True but if its bad at the start usually stays hard
I feel like I usually see them the other way
That was what made me think it was kind of noteworthy tbh
Its not supposed to be like that
Sometimes stuff like this is all about perspective
Not so crazy now huh
Took a live by mistake leave me alone
But there is a car fully upside down in front of scofflaw
No I had to take the picture on the sky and I thought it turned out
Ah shit
thats what i was gonna say girl
bisexual movie star voted for No in the poll
SpongeBob father of one voted for No in the poll
bruh 
Andrew Ill just say this
Jeff voted for No in the poll
Leaving it up so I can learn to sit my ass down and listen
Dont like that riff
On the red pill network
Ill be back in chicago next weekend
Only if its a podcast
I have been working out some ideas
Lmk if you wanna talk about women as a whole one of these days on a google video hang
Yeah like I feel like communication is actually one of the difficult parts of a relationship that isnt good after  dates and takes work but we
also early breakups suck bc i feel like nobody knows how to say hey just not feeling it
And add each other on Linkdn
All you gotta say is its not the right connection
After four dates
Citing specifics for why something isnt working is a red flag
the lil beekeepers son voted for No in the poll
A Brooklyn heartache is required within the first few months you juuuuust squeaked it in
Yeah see I thought this was a thing we had going for us lol
also this is a bad time to announce im gonna go no sugar diet in january and id love to have a great dinner with everyone before the year is over
but overall andrew u dont want someone whos just picking u apart instead of working with you seems like they have some communicating to do themselves
Its super weird being a people pleaser with a person who is sending mixed messages like that makes you feel a lil nuts
I stand by it
Hahahaha
oh come on say it
Nevermind I am actually chill
doorcam voted for No in the poll
God I just feel so Autistic
i for one like a vent sesh and am happy to help
Is this true about women
Appreciate the kind words folks sorry to put this in the chat instead of my regular brand of proactive comedy
Amen
more importantly women will always find a reason to be mad at u
You didnt do anything she just wasnt the person for you and thats ok It sucks for sure but you didnt do anything wrong
People dont get less difficult the more you know them
I think its perfectly reasonable to be confused if just think of this as saving you a lot of figure grief
its giving bpd no shade
Especially at the start
things should be easy not confusing and hard
Im saying it was maybe not worth it considering its been confusing the whole time
My vote is not in regards to your situation I just think you are one of the few people in the chat who shouldnt ever be confused and it is wrong if you ever are
Yeah we were like having a perfectly fine night and then she kinda just broke it off and started citing all these small weird moments we had
Mitchie changed their vote to No in the poll
but also this kind of pattern this early on maybe ya dodged a bullet
Mitchie voted for Yes in the poll
no i would be genuinely so confused
Oh yeah no I feel like she was giving off mixed signals this whole time And also shes just been weird in general like the night she randomly seemed pissed at me before Id spoken to her despite nothing having happened between us and then she was fine the next time I saw her
Eric Sony and Hypnosis voted for Yes in the poll
Samuel Housing Authority voted for No in the poll
bacon egg and cheese created a poll Is Andrew wrong for being conf
clear sign that your communication skills need work
I thought this would be a poll
Am I wrong for being confused by this
And also doesnt want to text which is a boundary Ive been respecting
The girl Ive been seeing ended things with me last night and she said it was because we arent communicating well But weve been on like  dates and she specifically told me she wanted to take it slow
Id consider it the main point of the chat
Go off
Can I poll the chat on a question about my personal life please
Its the busiest Costco in the Midwest

Onstage
Imagine I get onstage and fall right over cheetos spilling everywhere
If the audience were good I would have swept them up myself and used them for my entrance
Ok last night I saw a man at LF trip and spill a bag of cheetos and it truly made me laugh harder than any comedy show
Ive heard mixed things
How was it
at a yk screeening and its empty
I submitted a bunch of old ones to the treasurer and it still hasnt cleared
You might be able to cash that in directly to the bank to avoid the treasury
They take so long to cash in
Just not like dying laughing or anything
Audience is listening
Its not bad
""
How many audience members are there Johnbo Walter Stockwell 
WHAT THE SAM HELL
The important thing is that the comedy show continues even if its bad and nobody wants to be there
Cowboys been tucking himself in recently

Thank you Randy Jacksons
Yeeeeeah its gonna be a happy birthday from me dawg Sam Otter doing his famous Randy Jackson
"shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit its your birthday Meg Mc  

clay davis from the wire never watched it but assume this is the context"
Happy birfday Megan
Happy birthday Megan
Yeeeeeah its gonna be a happy birthday from me dawg Randy Jackson
happy birthday Meg Mc  
Was it good I want to see it
think im gonna see it tn
is yk any good
Gah every pic of her goes hard
Missing her
Yeah thats the worst part
Ya and I think opposition is doubling coming down on him and trying to make his shortcomings more of a thing to point to never electing like a teacher or left leaning guy again
But thats kind or more vibe based than anything
I also think maybe he wasnt the best choice for CTU to tap for the nomination and hes having the pay the price for not being a food enough politician to do the job well
Its really good
Anybody play chants of sennaar
Become a comedian
I think with Brandon Johnson a lot of people on both sides of the issue arent loving how hes handling the migrant crisis
I think Anthony Siraguse said he surrounded himself with a badincompetent team
I feel like hes doing not a great job overall but also all the videos I see of him and the comments are def heavily pushing an agenda
Love the vibe but Im neutral on the taste
IDK about the Brandon johnson stuff
Diet Coke propaganda has been everywhere lately
Id be right there with her 
I saw someone yelling at the meeting today and I was like wheres this coming from
Lisa Barlow marches on Washington
Is it holding up pension payments
I dont get that part
Yeah but like why do normal people care
Its like how rfk said hes going to get rid of Diet Coke as soon as trump is inaugurated
he keeps holding off the budget
Does anyone know why emotions are high with Brandon Johnson
No its bc tiktok is where everyone is finding out about genocide and they dont have control over the flow of information in the same way
Ill have an update for you tomorrow on progress
I started working on em today
Hahahahahahahaha
They found out how much storage space they were paying for when they saw all the unread Tik Toks in John and Aarons inbox from me
But who knows
I feel like Congress sees it as more of an existential risk if China has access to that data
im gonna go non verbal
no one should be allowed to benefit from your data unless they work for a good old fashioned american company
this is happening to protect you from china
why
wait why is this happening to us
Oh man chat is gonna have a rough week
it is so much worse than tt its kinda crazy
no ik thats why I was trying to figure out reels
i have like a severe addiction and idk how im gonna handle being cold turkey
wait this is like really not good for my whole thing i got going on where i lay in bed and watch tiktoks until danny gets worried

Thank u kings
Or a screw extractor
Ill look for pliers
And thank you WAYFAIR
Ohhh good idea thank you 
Since the threads are exposed on the opposite side easiest solution might be to grip it with pliers on that end and twist
In a pinch you can use the Allen key with it but put some aluminum foil around it and shove it in until you have enough grip to turn it
Maybe if you can grip it with pliers you can unscrew it
You need a screw extractor

whats going on
Thats really smart to have thought to done that
yeah i came up with remembering this just now
Thats a really beautiful poem 
Did u just come up with that
"Im gonna make a change
For once in my life
Its gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind pretending not to see their needs

A summers disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one mans soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
Cause they got nowhere to go
Thats why I want you to know

Im starting with the man in the mirror
Im asking him to change his ways
And no  couldve been any clearer
If they wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Ive been a victim of a selfish kind of love
Its time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that theyre not alone

A willow deeply scarred
Somebodys broken heart
And a washed out dream washed out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya see
Cause they got no place to be
Thats why Im starting with me

Im starting with the man in the mirror oh
Im asking him to change his ways oh
And no  couldve been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Im starting with the man in the mirror oh
Im asking him to change his ways oh
And no  couldve been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change

Im starting with the man in the mirror oh yeah
Im asking him to change his ways better change
No  couldve been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change

You gotta get it right while you got the time
Cause when you close your heart you cant
Then you close your close your your mind
With the man in the mirror oh yeah
Im asking him to change his ways better change
No  couldve been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Oh yeah gonna feel real good now

Im gonna make a change
Its gonna feel real good
Come on change
Just lift yourself
You know
Youve got to stop it
Yourself yeah

Make that change
Ive got to make that change today
Man in the mirror you got to
You got to not let yourself brother
Yeah you know
Make that change Ive got to get that man that man

Youve got to
Youve got to move
Come on
Come on
You got to
Stand up stand up yeah make that change
Stand up

Stand up and lift
Yourself now
Man in the mirror

Yeah make that change
Gonna make that change come on
Man in the mirror

You know it
You know it
You know it
You know
Change
Make that change"
yeah to that ill say
And insulted youd say it is
Not the same
Sorry its not
yeah ive been running in shorts and figure its similar
Its pretty nice
Ive been doing cold plunges on my legs after skateboarding
Ooof
i have not and i cant believe i ever did that it was so cold
That may be the difference here
Have you been keeping up on cold plunging
i dont think luigi should have yelled at the media but im no vigilante
my close personal friend avatara
is instagram down
Just leave behind a Drive Damage Depart sticker
But I could hitandrun a CEOs car
Im not quite hardcore enough to do the full Luigi
The hit and runners manifesto
"Drive
Damage
Depart"
"Damage
Dump
Demolish"
I cant believe theyd put in this much planning just to take out your means of transportation
This is like when Luigi Mangione shot that CEO but its a city worker and your car
Its nice you got the note
Is ur car drive able
Idk but people left a note with a plate number
Are u gonna be compensated
How did u find out
Damn that sucks man
A sanitation truck hit my parked car
This is really really funny
it was obv tasty but the best thing was watching all the like Bridgeport lifer groundskeeping old dudes be like what da hell is this I dont know about soup you eat with chopsticks
it was soo sick
the only thing getting me through the day is that they had a pho bar at the white sox employee cafeteria
In light of recent events I will now always be coated in a layer of our experimental bulletproof lotion for men
it was more like so crazy that Luigi did that I actually know his family
no his family is like prominent in Baltimore
Im actually cool if you get me
Im not like other ceos
Is he trying to be like a pick me ceo
Yeah what was his take or perspective
I bet he was like at the same country club party as them
the ceo is from Maryland so is probably just bragging about proximity to wealth
I would instantly stop liking him if I knew he bought from this company
Do you guys sell trigger finger lotion
Look him up in the system and see if he bought anything
Cant believe messenger is out when I just heard the tiege ceo say that he knew Luigis parents
Kingdom Come Deliverance
Lemme boot it up right now and check
I feel like Id love that
Which game
And play my game about being a medieval peasant
Just wanna chill
Im struggling to work these past few days
Office vibes are particularly bleak today
weird phone who dis
yeah one sec my phone is weird
Did you also send the response
I dont know that it is
is it not sending
I know we have a long history and the kids miss you but Im featuring you in a piece Im writing for the New Yorker
like i sucked ur thumb for two hours one night ago threee years ago dont talk to me like im ur ex wife
ok but dont u hate this response
hahaHAHAHA
Thats much better than him asking about the ass cookies
Oh lol
however it is all about the tramp stamp show promo
so i assumed it was my latest reel
oh wait yeah forgot to update its not the reel its roadkill show poster actually i was scared to open it at first
Yeah weird If it was a listicle or something itd make sense if he wanted a quote or something to add to it but
i asked him what hes writing about and he said a column on organic promo that hes sending to many industry people and then sent  ur welcome xx
i think its weird that he wasnt like hey im thinking about writing about u for this what do u think
hes a social media analyst thats not the weird part to me
Why would he need the insights
To ask for food in want I make the animal noises 
featuring it for an article
Lmfao
ask if im ok w that first hahahaha
does he have to like
that stamptown brother i hooked up w three years ago just randomly DMd me can i have the insights for ur latest reel featuring it on an article
I hear if you die in Japan you die in real life
Yeah I guess
That would probably happen here too honestly
A guy mean mugged me bc I showed his girl shrek
At a club in Japan and kept showing girls pictures of shrek
I would honestly love to see the vibe
Damn true
Isnt that better than work
But consider this you get to pay  to watch other people who think paying  for an open mic is a good idea and you cant leave
pm on a Wednesday is a horrible time
And I cant I work normal hours
I know the host
Fear City indeed
you couldnt design a worse open mic
arbitrary threats of banning
no list chosen at random
being punished for showing any time before 
Pay to go up
PM
Ill venmo you  to go to this
you need to go for me
What schizophrenic posted this
You can tell all of NYs best comics go to this mic
Ive walked by it and been bummed out just by the vibe from outside
This place seems awesome
Also sorry but being banned from Fear City comedy club is like being banned from Kansas I wasnt going anyways
I think its cool to pay for something and get banned for having to leave a bit early
Idk I think its about time that somebody made open mics feel like a bad time
Hellish vibe
Getting Christmas cards ready
I liked it
Thinking about defending my polycues honor
Pretty good
Any you seen Black Doves on Netflix
genuinely amazing post
Whos he talking about
On my insta story
JFL Vancouver haha  to how I said I was flicking the bean to their poster

Me too in addition as well pls
Absolutely

Just sent it to you
Is there an FB event for the LF party I feel like there usually is one
Love it
Mitch lowkey a sassy brat
Im gonna ask  comics who Ive never spoken to if they want to produce a lodge show with me
Im gonna tell everyone they were snubbed by the gazellies this year
Its incredible
People who do two mics a year walk up to you and just say Im doing some networking with you right now
Its one of the rare times all of my favorite people and all of my least favorite people are in the same room
I cant wait
Its the best people watching day of the year
Im gonna tell Katie Zane to keep at it
I thought it was usually thursdays but Im gonna go and get so drunk that I tell Chicagos worst comedians that I love them
It seems feral
Whats the vibe of it
No tomorrow
wait is the LF party tonight
no Im asking
I feel like they usually cancel it the week of the holiday party
Oh yeah maybe the mic is off
LF holiday party is this week
Just in case
Bring your packet
Mostly a place to network for laughable news
Go with the expectation you will not be performing
Tough to get on
Yeah its fun
Has anyone done the laugh factory mic before
No
Nvm
Is In lieu of gi anything
Theres a guy here who keeps saying he looks like Luigi and its likebuddy you look nothing like him
I want the whole chat to go
If you guys dont go to Japan Im gonna be so mad
I keep meeting Israelis who are hot 
new years resolution is to write more manifestos
everyone maintain joint mobility please  literally move your joints to keep em healthy especially your back
honestly the biggest takeaway ive learned so far is to never get back surgery
the th grader i tutored had experience in this assassin game
"

Manifesto dropped"
i  dropshipping
currently writing about how there is so much merch for Luigi because of the rise of print on demand Its so funny that every etsy seller selling deny defend depose tshirts also has MAGA shirts and pride shirts for sale in there shops
""
If you want a good take perchance
I concerned people are going to start slapping standups
I feel like so many journalists are disconnected from reality
do something 
Im just obsessed with the fact that the guy was a lindy manpaul skallas head
Waiting on the steakums x account to weigh in
But no company or brand is going to be like we agree with the internet Its good that the ceo was killedl
Yeah so many people see it as the senseless taking of a life like any other murder instead of a targeted attack of the head of a company that sent a  that desperately needed to be sent
Nooooooooo
Oh nooooo shooters are going start trying to shoot rich powerful politically polarizing people
Because then every loser will want to be him instead of shooting innocent people at a mall
Thats why its cool that hes hot and impressive
Targeted killings in
Mass shootings out
smdh
dont love the chanification of john stockwell
smdh
Next youre gonna ask what skibidi toilet is
Just sit in your apartment looking at the wall
Jesus Christ what do you do all day
blaming everything i dont like on the chanification
I guess these people will throw any garbage take against the wall tho instead of giving any sort of weight to the fact that an overwhelming majority of people like that this guy did that
this is just as bad as when incels celebrate school shootings
The chanification
Lol what a stupid take
""
worst take alert
He excelled in evading the police after evading the goose in duck duck go
"Or like 

He did a mob hit and we learned that him and his friends were a group that regularly role played as mob members 

In the card game Mafia"
"Basically the equivalent of being like 

This murderer who killed a plumber has some experience with this because in college he played Mario video games"
Can someone explain to a nongamer what this means
The humble comedian
Humble
I think some studios are selling cool art but I will just simply have photos of my friends doing plays and a bunch of beers
Spreading this invite far and wide cuz I think it will be very fun and also I owe everyone a beer for making you listen to my UHC shooter conspiracy theory 
""
Feeling cool 
Opportunity to have a cool roommate
idk why they would make up something like thaty
yeah dont be scared of that
I dont think thats true
someone said this means theres a waluigi working in private equity somewhere
Free Luigi
Damn
Like what the fuck
Im diving deep into this luigi stuff man
""
Getting paid to poop is one of the small pleasures of working And nobody will question it because its embarrassing for them
Any relation to the satire writer Nate Odenkirk
its been  min and they gotttaaa be wondering where i am but i do t wanna text my manager that im pooooping in a major way
stuck on the toilet at work its hell on earth
The perfect spot to reflect
hes repped by naomi odenkirk
Which is maybe why he was just hanging in a McDonalds I mean
I think this is  right I was thinking about how America is so accustomed to senseless violence that when there is a logic or sense to what someone did there is a immediate sympathy and kind of assuming hes a genius But he can be both kinda smart and also kinda manic and not thinking through what would happen afterwards
lol
Jake Prizant is in a Potbelly ad
but i do magnesium and ashwagunda and cortisol reducers
ok not to out myself as a hippie
I use a drug called marijuana spelling when Im anxious
Not a book and maybe unhelpful but I know people who have taken magnesium pills to help with anxiety symptoms
Ive heard those are good idk my brain is fine
The worry trick the untethered soul the art of letting go
I have it in my hotel room Ill try to find it
Teaches you to be your friend along da way
Oh um I think this self compassion book goes hard
Quran
How to gain friends and win influence
Sorry chat but does anyone have any book recs for dealing with anxiety Ive got some goals Im trying to achieve that are definitely not related to recent news events
Also new sick jacket for cheap
Some Russians did a photoshoot with me
Now that the dust has settled a little bit from today it needs to be appreciated how fucking funny it is that William Bankss big project that hes been working on for months was launched on the day of the biggest arrest and jailing in recent history
I also believe he had a lot of actual material
I love what Ryans doing onstage and am laughing with not at him ftr
It kind of intersects with laughing at him
it also would have been a  hour and  min show but mike robinson dropped
Like you can give him the phone book and it would be fun to watch him read it
Like they dont make jokes they just ARE and its funny to watch
ryan did so bad that grace called kiehron in to drop in after his set
Thats the category of comic he falls into Ive seen them before
I was real stoked to see you did Rib tips at lf
not only was it two hours long but it was  hours and fifteen minutes
Also how was your 
Wait can you confirm that this show is  hours long
im genuinely confused if people are making fun of him or like him
What if she had her period halfway through
I dont think a woman could do that set
IDK
i feel like if a girl did that set they simply wouldnt book her
Poor kid
But I also get how he could bomb for  minutes straight lol
Yeah hes one of those people whose jokes arent for anyone idk how to describe it I like seeing him on stage
Hahahahahahahahahaha
Im all in on Ryan
He crushed for  minutes straight at his laugh factory show
it was silent for  min
he followed me at headliners
Where are you watching Ryan do  mins
Does anyone emotionally connect to this hat
One day hes gonna be a  year old man who acts like that
This is his past life
Hes not meant for this timeline
He is supposed to be a s dustbowl vagrant working for beans from farm to farm train to train
i just dont get whats real im confused
im like is he trying to do like joe pera core
He dont seem like a tantrum guy
Unless theyre throwing a tantrum
No one really bombs on purpose
Idk man
I think he thinks they just dont get it
hes walked five people so far hes half way thru his half hour
or is he just binning
is ryan oliver going for like bombing
ok im confused
Bought this bad boy
and then we can decide the pope of the chat
When you see it well add you to conclave chat
I saw it as well With Adrienne Stout
i loved it
Adrienne Stout saw it
Might fuck around and hit up a matinee tomorrow
Hate to distract from the assassin talk but has anyone in the chat seen conclave
Wonder if Luigi and William Banks are in the same jail
ive heard of a haircut but thats ridiculous
Dude paid attention to literally each strand of hair
conspiracy twitter discovering the concept of a scatterbrained genius
Knows his angles
Gotta hit the gym and work on my assassin bod
he sounds like an esfj
Murder for a cause is so sigma
Hed be a hero to everyone
I feel like inmates would love him
the fact is that he was a meatball but the question is was he neurospicy well have to wait to see the court evidence
I want a John wick quiet gun
And no one catch him
It would have been so sick for CEOs to live in permanent fear
I saw a video of someone using the same gun setup and its literally silent Its just clicking noises lol that insane that thats legal
Eating a cheeseburger was actually the activation action for my and hundreds of other sleeper cell ivy league school Andrew huberman trained assassins
Italian intuition
The silencer and the weird bullets
""
he should have gotten time and a half to prepare
Im just so curious how he got that insane load out
Very Italian to lower your mask to flirt
Maybe he had sensory sensitivities and had to let the skin breathe
a slightly impulsive meatball
i guess its a trade off between looking normal and being camouflaged but seems very not smart to have been bare faced on surveillance
If he wore a prosthetic  face I think he wouldve gotten away with it
united healthcare is so bad
Bro
""
Egirl hiding in cakes
People are gonna break into jail to fuck him
lol
im gagged
im sorry but the girl i had every class at depaul with making it in this post
Hot guy name I guess
Can I just add a random Italian as a placeholder
Oh nvm
Would we be on a watchlist if I add him to the chat
all his socials are deleted now
His was different somehow
We mustve not been smoking the same weed
Hes just like every dude I smoked weed with in college for real
Thats all Trump does about healthcare lol
Goddamn
It would be such a wild card if Trump pardoned him
Michell Potts Pardon Power 
Not if I have anything to say about it
Damn imagine if the trump shooter lived to hear himself get compared to this chad
Hell see it in 
Just the word respect
Joe has DMd him
They dont have the chops
Are we competing with Joe Eames chat
So this is how brat summer ends Not with a whimper but a bang
I only just got around to following him on IG and let me tell ya we are not the only group chat thirsting after our boy Luigi
I know hes probably dealing with a lot but I do wonder if part of him is like my boys chat is going off right now
adding Kill Bluecross CEO to my goals
going over my self evaluation for the year

Hes one of charlis angels 
If hed finished level  those bullets would have said zip zap zop
Representation is so important
Somebody on Twitter confirmed that hes taken at least one improv class
Hes so foine
wish i could DM her lol
That is absolutely wild
Oh my god
i had like every depaul class w the girl in this pic
a girl i went to depaul with is his friend
going back to the assassin
Go off
this day is a rollercoaster
god i have more gossip
Cant stop watching sister wives today
its absolute reddit humor
Hes already got a guy throwing gang signs
Like the idea of the bit is funny but I feel like hes going to hit some pretty rough stereotypes
Like its an annoying movement but even lamer to not get that its a joke as a comic
Theres a comic at that laugh factory that has a bit about this but she doesnt understand its a joke so she just looks silly
It feels like when Elon Musk references Dogecoin
Its really lame
Or he shouldve filmed his court trial and found out that the judge has a car world tattoo
its been fun playing journalist i cannot lie
Im going to New York this weekend and Im going to free him from his bit
he just needs to post this
Its very easy actually to end the bit without going back which is just be like they released me from prison early due to good behavior
clare austen smith  bianca ian lockwood
few sources
ive gone too far i cant go back
like literally so is a hotdog a sandwichcore
and he is like
i guess one of his friends talked to him and was like u can really stop this u know
Who is your source or is it confidential
Thats awesome and will go over well
I cannot stand the birds arent real thing

In mine craft parody etc
Why cant we do the same with alt comedians
The FBI does it with mentally ill people all the time
Honestly we should be enabling William Banks to be the next Mangione

my resume is more tailored to tall rasta guy
damn
For technicians yes We had two Rasta guys  one really short and one very tall and the short one quit yesterday
Hell are they hiring
Could be worse
And its closer to my apartment than when I worked in midtown and I work only  as opposed to  like I did
Thats the spirit
Gonna be honest Easiest job Ive ever had though
Hey Sam this job sounds like it sucks
And everyone was very chill about it
Today there was a woman who barricaded herself and someone else in their apartment and was like making threats and cops got called and ALSO in another building a guy got shot and killed
Still fine I think
but also the person in contact is the recruiter not the girl who interviewed me
downtown hunni more like my ass on the couch
Oh you can follow up day of
Its been plenty of time its not uncommon for folks to followup after an interview with a thank you and stuff the same day
End of Week Is that how they do it That rules Kristi congrats And congrats on your new life as a downtown good Samaritan Anthony

Debbie is thriving
OK the purse has been returned
Can you pick up a standing desk for me too
Hahahahaha
my pussy i fuck i have a small wiener
What was that quote from comedy gazelle fuck pussy bitch
This was honestly my first thought but I didnt want to make assumptions
""
And all I humbly ask for is a finders fee of 
Oh hell yeah
Major Deborah update I am on the train to the daley center to return her the purse
Despite all my rage Im am still just a leader who leads 
I thought it was about if a police officer a native American a sailor and a construction worker got gym memberships
Liketheres no way to not come off as homophobic with  that
Its a pretty incredible thing to sue someone about
The quote is its about black guys hanging out theres nothing gay about that
I just read an article about how the guy from the village people who wrote ymca is going to start suing news networks for calling it a gay anthem
Thats a big leaders who lead opportunity
You also have the opportunity to be the first person who likes this
Im glad youre treating yourself while you have COVID
"The bullets say
Middle seats only
No priority boarding
 carryon charge "
Yall can keep dancing on the graves of our brave leaders I will be celebrating them
retvrn 
you used to be able to smoke on the plane people dressed up
I mean its sooo annoying to fly now
Thats the world I wanna live in
Imagine killing the ceo of your airline cuz your flight got delayed
Right but thats a manufacturer
well u really want the boeing ceos to be found in a ditch
Im less hardline about airline ceos but I did learn yesterday that ultimately Im fine with them getting killed too
gonna watch the joker tn
When I realized it was the healthcare company I was immediately like oh yeah well he should die
I thought it was the other United though so I was confused
I was on a date last night and she really didnt like how glad I was that the guy was murdered
Theyre stoked
wait i thought everyone was lowkey excited
 watching someone get murdered  Ill have what hes having
Yeah only if after we get murdered we go to Katz
bleeding out in the street only in New York
Bro Ill be in New York next week lets do the legendary hang of Starbucks photo op getting murdered
This city never sleeps Manhattan is always a party
What if the bullets said pussy money weed
I was like damn thats hardcore but if thats what were doing Im onboard
I only skimmed the headline yesterday and thought everyone was real excited about the ceo of united airlines getting killed
If youre going to pull something crazy like this youd be stupid not do do something like that
Somebody posted this in the Simpsons Reddit and its perfect
Its like ok one guy getting killed in the street like a dog is sad in itself but dont ask me to mourn for him any harder than the literal millions of people who have suffered and died far worse deaths due to the very profitable choices made by people like this guy
kinda wild hes still at large
I saw this really good quote from Mark twain that I think sums up how many people are feeling about this incident
Also he was wearing a camera backpack lol
Thats why in the video hes constantly pulling the back of the gun
The gun didnt jam hes using subsonic rounds that dont automatically eject so he has to eject them by hand the subsonic rounds with the silencer made it much much quieter
Also whats crazy
Some riddler ass shit
Also whats crazy about the assassin he left bullets that had written on them words like defend deny depose
I saw them
They flirted at a party
mf not getting caught
Shes a long time supporter of laughable news
Hahahahaha
im going to have a convo with her
why does my younger sister follow brian roe
Yeah there were some stories of there saying he got away on a citi bike but now theyre saying that didnt happen nor sure what to believe in regards to that but he is still at large
I think its safe to say he knows someone who died or greatly suffered from the company fucking up their life because pretty much all of us know someone thats happened to
and he was just on a bike
Im going to go out on a limb and say there was intent
Its united Healthcare they are notable for denying claims at a higher rate than other companies
brian roe is a babe
like with intention or just random
wooooah
In da big apple
wait it was on a lime scooter but for bikes
A guy just walked up to a CEO of a major health care company and fucking smoked him
was he a bad guy
why did he get got
He was being too good at being a ceo
wait ok still havent checked my phone in a major way  did a ceo get assassinated
Jesus fucking christ lol
Good song for the daft punk type fans tbh
This slaps
Hold on
"

My top track this year"
I think a lot of CEOs have gone in and out of court for anti trust or insider trading stuff My impression is that its sort of normal honestly
Too cold inside
Where are folks tonight
Lmao thats a pretty good Photoshop
Deborah Johnigan Protector any update from Deb
Lmaoooooo get his ass
Am I seeing double
Easy choice
And unearned confidence
Bro has an ugly soul
Honestly so funny that women think he is hot until he starts speaking
Lol so many people have his face shape
Yes they have the same face shape
Anybody else get Brian roe vibes from Nick on love is blind
Jolly beans burner account
Constructive criticism stings the most
I apologized getting a hang of key phrases
"A museum worker approached me and some reason 
my first thought was my ween shirt was too casual for the imperial palace it was for chewing gum"
Im gonna submit a packet to laughable news
They were able to see straight thru all the production and jokes
Lol yeah its crazy that Brian wasnt able to pull a fast one over on randos
know
Damn even the randoms think its bad
Damn
Hes gonna have to put the stream up early or he might crash the servers
Laughable News tomorrow is going to be ELECTRIC
The laughable news
Oh gosh
Cant wait for Brian Roes take on this whole thing
Hahahahahaha
Got smoked twice today
Damn he got smoked
k laugh reacts
You do Im just being a radical extremist
We all know the hierarchy goes this one health care CEO and then landlords are next
I feel like I make a good case 
And besides
You just have bad opinions
No of course nto
THE BIRTHDAY CURSE HAS NO EFFECT ON MY OPINIONS
Hes the most establishment person in the group chat
I think they have camera footage of it
Well we should also take everything John says with a grain of salt
how do they know it was a citi bike and not just like his own electric bike
A high tourist and commuter area Wherever he leaves that eCiti bike its getting used by someone else within the next  minutes
Think about it too
There are def ways to get an electric citi bike and not have the account or card youre using traced back to you
"The options are 
 On foot
 Bike
 Motorcycle"
Also I feel like getting away on an electric Citi bike is the play in Manhattan you cant drive a car down there and anything else is public transit
Really straight forward
 of the time to unjam a gun you basically just cock the gun again
Sincerely not hard
Climate Conscious healthcare defending king 
""
changed the location to rainbo club
ive been running around looking for balloons
wait what was there a shooting
But of course they mispronounced it  fml NowWellNeverKnow
I just saw the clip where the Starbucks workers are trying to read the name written on the killers gun before they hand it off to him
I just found a clip where you can hear the audio and the shooter goes sir will you sign my gun Oh no Its slipping out of my hands and then the gun goes off and he goes noooo I didnt mean to kill you
Idk maybe more people will ruminate on stuff like this
Its like u got the shinzo abe guy and then this one
And idk maybe nothing will happen but if they dont find the killer or dif up more info
Well even if there was a conspiracysomething to cover up shareholders I think most people will probably buy that this was a frustrated citizen caught up in grievances
The citizens of kms avenue are hanging on by a thread
You guys please do not solve this I need this
But at the end of the day I think it was just all a big misunderstanding that was actually also an accident
Citi bike thing is a good point that seems v trackable
no pressure i know theres this thing called coles tn
but probs pm bar time
time TBD were going to ahkoshi by mustache so were about to see how long were waiting
Yo whats up guys welcome to how to kill a CEO in broad daylight todays video is brought to you by DRAFTKINGS sportsbook
Tell him Happy birthday day from me
and im gonna surprise him at best intentions after dinner with pals
Yooo
its my boyfriends bday
but at the end of the day
wait sorry i know were in a big convo
I feel like based on these new conspiracy things arising this will be quickly memoryholed like the airline whistleblower they killed
But if I was shooting someone and my gun jammed I would look up how to unjam a gun youtube skim through it get to the part where they do it and watch it a couple times
Also I dont know anything about guns
And you go to thailand and hes drinking at the end of the bar
It would be wild if they never did
Its assumed that they will find him
He was buying the Starbucks New York mugs
Sorry if thats a dumb  question I dont want to learn things about NYC
Also are Citi Bikes not linked to your phone Shouldnt they have like all of the guys information
I bet he got one of those Stanley cups and was killed for it 
We dont know
Thats the thing
What was his order
  
Yeah either way we win
CEOs should be scared to be in public 
But I really want to believe its a vigilante
No im getting to the bottom of this
But this is one where I kind of hope we just never know
Hell fucking yeah
I totally agree with you Matty
It feels more like a were worried this guy is gonna flip mob style hit
Yeah I had no idea about the Starbucks camera but thats really interesting
Yea now youre with me Mitchell
Yes Thats what Im saying It doesnt line up that he is on Starbucks cameras also
I think someone not trained wouldve panicked when the gun jammed
The assassin really seemed to know what they were doing
Cuz its like hell yeah
I want it to be angry guy for sure
No totallyyyyy
So I actually think the conspiracy angle is more likely but I find it more inspirational to believe it is a guy who had a claim denied
I think United healthcare is trying to make it seem like its an angry person who like had a claim denied
He rides one of the most trackable modes of transportation
Idk like they have pics of him in a Starbucks This guy just wanted to be seen
Yeah it feels crazy they didnt catch him immediately
In summary insider trading all the stuff about him being in a Starbucks right before the shooting and getting his photo taken and riding a Citibike
Alright fine Ill listen to your podcast
It is well known that Joey has CIA ties
Hahahaha
Im sending a voice memo
Go on
I saw he was getting investigated for insider training
I had to write about it for work and I think it was an inside job sorry I really do
Wait guys I think it was a conspiracy
I just hope we dont see like record speed from congress passing legislation adding extra rights and protection to ceos
If we want any change we gotta get John hinkley jr off his meds
Io
 example of something I would say if I was a crazy guy and not an honest citizen who would never wish harm on someone I love my government
Truly this needs to happen more These people need to be terrified to walk on the streets
Good fun violence works too
It may be This could be huge
King shit
Love that he biked away
If this guy drops a merch store you know Ill be buying
Sometimes violence IS the answer
My company had been BCBS for years and just switched to united for 
gun
Its just nice to see that we are getting some good fun violence over here for once
Ya dont know if theres any hot takes on something that most people universally like or appreciate
goes without saying we approve
Checking in after a long day and honestly Thought the chat was gonna have more hot takes on the united ceo
it probably is bc it says he works at standup comedian 
thats a name i recognize
was it david louis
Mallory Bradford
tina fey
Or Lewis
David something
A friend is asking who hosted the second city open mic in 
Sold out I think idk this shit is goofy
Oh shit but they wear masks for this
Maybe tonight Ill do music
I think Im gonna stick to the boxing
I wonder if wrestling would be more fun tho
My favorite anime has boxing tournaments here
It lacks awareness lol
Lmao I know and I dont understand it either I know cartoonists make like distinctive choices in their drawing style to distinguish their work from other artists But this dude is kind of completely ripping off South Park in every other way
I know you mean racist people but it really looks like youre agreeing with a point hes making
Why do all of their chins look like that
And a little bit Kamala Harris
Sorry it just seems to be Lawrence Fishburn
He does the voice of every black person with an egregious blaccent
every video this guy makes he tags adultswim lmao
something I ALSO kindof really want
they have Gutfeld swag
It devastated me
My mom told me on thanksgiving that shes a big Greg Gutfeld fan
jokes is a strong word for it
Hes literally just ripping off South Park and making conservative oriented jokes
In Japan right now btw
I think its because I was looking at the fox news shop maybe
""
Even better
Also heres something fun to hate watch that I just found
Just get it as is
HAHAHAHAHA
This one is great because you can pretend that youre a host
That is some unregulated emotional fuckery tho lol
Met her at my job and forever like her
I love her still tbh
that would rock
yeah just steal the design
get a cease and desist
Make your own
god I kinda want some fox merch but I dont wanna support fox news
oh man Im gonna make a video about this
I THINK YOU MEAN CHRISTMAS
HOLIDAY

Yes
Was this her email dajohnigancookcountycourtcom

Mary texted her friend Hannah who literally knows Audrey lol I think they work together
I returned it to his social worker to get it back to him
Circuit Court is what Audrey says
One time I found this teens wallet and he was homeless 
Yeah
Yeah civil dept
Also you could probably bring it to the county building
I just texted Audrey Jonas because she works for the county too and Im like maybe thats her department

THC bomb in the beer tub 
theres a natural human urge to soak in a tub full of something thats not water
But still not sure of the benefits unless you had like an extremely misguided scheme to try to frame someone for drink driving or something
idc if its good for me or not
I lowkey want it to be a bath full of beer
Ya its not literally a bath full of beer I think its like mostly like a hop water bath
dont worry about it
confused why beer would be good to soak in but im in
this sounds perffff
And the part where you actually take a bath in the beerhop water is private for you and your partner
I think the only gendered part is the steam room I cant remember if thats gendered but i think thats also optional
oh hell yeah ty
Its on Milwaukee
Piva I think
Ya I did beer spa once I think its p accommodating
got a nd round interview in thirty min 
looking for the natural wine spa
you should ask one of them the only thing I remember is the phrase beer spa
beer spa im interested
cant remember what the deal with that is like
brook and annaleigh went to that beer spa one time
the only non naked spa is aire and its like  dollars
I was there on a heavy edible once and I thought everyone with a king spa shirt was working there like damn this place has a lot of employees
I like dont think anyone would be too weird on the dude side but I so get not risking it
They give you a uniform
the short king spa
we need a trans friendly spa
god dammit
yeah no clothes allowed in the baths parts
and u have to be naked right
You like king spa Name every temperature they have
I like the one where you  lie on a bunch of tiny wooden blocks
every temperature you can imagine
lol thats literally how I was gonna describe it
They have a bunch of rooms of various temperatures
what else can y do
everything else you can do co ed
the bath parts are the first thing you go through and those are gender separated
i asked before i know but i forget
or all naked gender separated
is king spa something u can do co ed

speaking of how coles is 
And we will NOT be bullied into having the biggest hack category taken away
The GayEllies
We should host a chat award show
He once lectured me on how Coles is bumper bowling for people who want to get Broad City back in the air
With great crowds
Like bombed hard
Hahahahaha he has been there so many times and bombed every time
Could make an argument that hes the worst comedian in Chicago
Comedy Gazelle shouldnt have taken James Najjar winning biggest hack back
Ive seen James He was bad
Ive never seen Bob Keen go to Coles
block party on kms avenue tonight
I cant believe James Najjar went with a  joke in the comments
yeah those were mean
Can Bob and James be banned too
Its so hard to find parking on kms avenue
Banning from doing comedy could be seen as a blessing
Literally every woman has a bad story about him
He sucks kristi dont let him get you down Hes so disingenuous with why he was banned
Since he claimed he got hacked bots have been responding to him
You handled it really well and you deserved more support earlier on
Im sorry you had to deal with this
even when deserved
its better this way but i will say banning people feels bad
Every single week he does something worthy of being banished
Even without being a creep he bullied an autistic man
Its the comedy version of an incel
god im gonna miss the way he brought energy into the room at all these shows
It was my greatest trick yet
Heeee showed up wasted and said some really rude shit
He shows up when you need him the most
i love that on kms avenue week for kristi noshod hopped in to play
At least he will learn and grow from without a doubt
and when i described everything to dustin and morgan they were like u know u can ban people right
he also grabbed the sign up list from me aggressively
Yeah Joey instigated by assuming the best out of people
So he had to be weird
You put him around women
Yeah he was setup to be weird
u guys set me up to be weird at crushes haahahah
he was like
when i told him i wasnt gonna bump him bc he makes my friends feel weird
Little did he know his email in bio could also be used for unbookingd
Dustin welcome to the resistance 
I am Jewish in response to my unsend
i talked to dustin and morgans about like WVERYTHING with him
i didnt even try to ban him
Can we get a behind the scenes Kristi
im sure its a very busy email box happy he saw it
his bio says email for bookings
its in his bio
Ummmmm worst parent ever
hahahahahaha
Id take a humper over a sitter any day
Its for humping
Its not even what the stool is for
To think you have that kind of hold over the room
If your legs are tired just lean against the wall
Truly the gall of an open micer who sits down during their set
Its offensive to think you get to sit down
Ban all stool sitters
How did coles get his email address
oy
"Can u guys send me your favorite Spotify playlists  

Im back on it"
Only thing I run to is the polls

Tbh you were the impetus for wanting to screen since you havent seen so basically you can pick the time
I got stuff I gotta do but if I can make it work and it were late enough Id be game
What time were you thinking
Okay I asked the other day but it might have gotten buried Would Saturday work for a MacGruber screening for anyone Or should I try a different day
True thank you
He probably thought it was funny
I feel kinda guilty Whats the best way to feel better about this

But skeptically
Ill continue watching
Theres something VERY fishy about this
Stop being so charming
Manipulative and charming
I wish he didnt do that because a show rec from cam is usually great but rn its a prank probably
This is all very Lestat of you
This is what he said he was going to say while laughing about you falling for his stuff
Richie i dont like joking around about this because nobody ever follows through on my show recs and the fact that john is watching this means so much to me
I was like thats not nice but cam kept saying I dont care about Johns time Im evil
At small bar cam was laughing so hard saying John is going to be watching this bi show but its actually very average
Its just such an incredible show
Lestat is very bi but also very abusive
johncrete  im sorry if i promised more bi
Ok there has been ONE bi interaction so far among many gay interactions in interview with a vampire
Yes
Are people still at Small Bar
Its not like a traditional place by any means but just v solid and nice and not too expensive
Weve only been once but Saba on Milwaukee

I think Kerry should get the meat grinder but idk I guess I just listen to women
""
See Im just here to back up Chet
No no no no no You can just get them to do it for free
look at this beauty
also I used to work at a meat counter and we had to clean the grinder between each different meat so if someone came in with deer meat to grind Id be kind of annoyed lol
you dont understand I want to buy the meat grinder
No need to buy a meat grinder
If you ask the meat counter at the deli I think theyll do it for you
I was thinking shepherds pie bc thats the only way Ive had venison before but also it means I would have an excuse to buy the meat grinder attachment for my stand mixer lol
what should I do with it
Its so good
Deer meat rocks
was given fresh deer meat at the polka night afters

I should emphasize I only want to go with people that are also going to be horny for all the actors in it
Giantspeak be like
Like crazy shes making significantly less
This woman is a para professional but basically foes the same job as me
But ya idk that was my big takeaway Im left thinking about is how could we make here more like over there
Thats not to say we as a people dont also have a greater culture where we treat teachers and service industry and retail like shit
That was the biggest takeaway from Japan for me is how blatantly better off everyone seemed to be there and how that highlights just how bad and worse people are treated here
Yeah man its really wretched
Like how sad someone that also works at a public school has a second job 
from a woman
I just bought fries at Popeyes from I work with Ive never felt worse about this country
Unfortunately i cannot see g tomorrow
You can really tell i watched a youtube video

Thanks for letting us know about things being fucked we care and shit
You are very easy to interact with
Overwhelming and unnecessary 
ive just had so much conflict this last month it really broke me tbh
i think hes always been bad but its gotten exponentially worse and i tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and was real with him and he freaked out on me
So glad to hear this
I would have the same reaction
"just took
a second for me to come forward with because i used to be friends w him tbh and it just made me anxious and sad"
victoria had my back and so did the bar
Too tired for this
Neighbor fucking 
Bad guy

UGH

Youre managing a lot at once and doing a good job sorry he has severe brain damage that hes making other peoples problem
You deserve help from the other host and the bar on this its not fair for you to have this all on you

Coles host is literally the front lines

Such a creep

I saw an outback steakhouse in Japan
Where are business trip executives supposed to get an affordable yet appetizing meal
The outback steakhouse near OHare closed 
Dont talk to me until Ive had unsending a   
We can do a merger with the megalopolis one
Can we do a Japanese groupchat
Being called Aaron sama feels so good
they stayed for Cameronsan
They came for Saku
Kramer manga
The Japanese famously love laugh factory style comics
This is very unusual
Ok now it sounds like I think they normally get a Japanese audience
Ive never been more upset after a good set
And i feel a deep loss that had i known that it would have been the best set of my life to adult play with that
But also i only learned afterwards that a lot of japanese people were using google translate on their phones to understand the sets
It was so fun
Love it when that happens
Laugh Factory had a Japanese audience tonight huh
how did the set go
The japanese people adore me

Pretzel  cat

Truly incredible
Its easy to forget these things
its freaking awesome up here
Me in first grade after watching happy feet
Glad you told us dude also sorry youre dealing with this
""
But youre responseaction is totally understandable and you can always share stuff like this in the chat
You could try reaching out to Sophie Biddle Not sure if that would also put u in a dont shoot the messenger type situation
Fuck Brian hicks and fuck zanies and fuck Fiji water
ugh that sucks dude im so sorry
I was even nervous to post it in the chat honestly
like yeah he probably wouldnt even get a slap on the wrist
i wonder what would even happen if u just like posted that DM online
no literally
I know and its that shitty thing where Im kind of ashamed of myself for letting it happen but also I dont want to kneecap myself for nothing
i get keepin chill for ur career it just sUCKS thats such an annoying dm
ugh i know ur right im just like god damn i wish they would get put on blast
Hes in charge
or a random
is brian the guy in charge there
But like what would change Who would care Id just get blacklisted there
Also he couldve just said we already booked a host he didnt have to explain that its because youre a woman
idk megan i feel like you could literally put him on blast rn
Im fat as hell 
Hes so likeable women relate to him too
Peyton is really kind of an everywoman not just an everyman
is brian the booker guy
wait nvm zanies
what venue is this
oh my god hahaha
He had Peyton Ruddy host for Steph Tolev last year
it was me
I am certain the man he chose will be wildly out of place and not vibe with the crowd at all
He wanted to make sure we knew this is Trumps America now
Why not just say you already have a host
Yeah theres literally nothing you could say that wouldnt just cement his decision that sucks
Hahahahahahahahaha
This is for Sophie Biddle I dont think her fans are begging for male voices
Watching the crowd slowly get confused and angry when they realize they dont get to hear a man speak for once
You know what women love Slumber party vibes
So I cant make a scene
What is this a woman themed show
And Im such a shill I just gave a thumbs up because tragically I do still want to work there
The human mind simply cannot comprehend three women on a show
And the male feature that was booked simply didnt show up
Had to watch Ralphie Roberts do a set about trying to get laid and also being married for  years
Also explains why I only ever host for male headliners who guess what dont really care for my vibe
Im gonna burn that place to the ground what the hell
I want to just send this in response
There are allmale host feature headliner shows all of the time
INSANE reasoning

Horse rug chat
We were so close to all having horse rugs
Yeah but he could never best the might of American industry
This was when medieval Europe was mad weak and stretched thin
He got to the borders
Dude ghengis khan was about to take over Europe but then he died
China really slaps them around these days
Chet hanks favorite country is Mongolia
dont tell anyone I told you
Its actually where Gehghis Kahn is buried
I see nothing wrong with what Joey said
Yeah so at least  of people
I wish the pergola did more to celebrate the Mongolian empire
The horse rug will be my pergola
My current rug got ruined 
Its less flooded but theyre still working on it
that depends on if your apartment is still flooded
Do you guys think I should buy this horse rug
Im sitting next to a lady at a coffee shop whos trying to sell a Tesla over the phone
Aaron Klopfer We have not
I would never purchase a woman They are people and not property Aaron
Women are  of all purchases
Cameron Gillette did you and da girl text yet 
Pickme lotion 
jr bacon CEO
Lotion for men for women is such a good idea
women are at least  of the market
I have been toying with this concept what if we also sold products to women
If you dont have a result its bc youre still searching for the best way that something can be done
Saying that you want to search or investigate is great bc it sounds smart but it never promises and end result
Layout a plan for a rival and better company
and everyone can take turns being gay or straight
In five years I hope theyll have figured out conversion therapy
You should say you want to investigate ways to innovate the way your job is done
ooh I love that
no I leave the lotion sales to more qualified people I just help the guys who already bought the lotion
In five years you see yourself settling down with a wife and kids You hope to have climbed the ladder enough to provide a comfortable suburban living for your wife and beautiful daughter
What is ur job Lotion salesman
Yeah  year plans are bs you just gotta find a way to write some goals that dont make it seem like you a promising to do more or deliver higher quality work
Aspirational but non threatening
this reminds of the religion classes I had to take in grade school
Say you wanna be CEO jr
whats the kind of five year plan that the worlds dumbest ceo might like to see

i was gonna make a joke about speed but you beat me to it guess they call that slow joking 
I sorta mightve It was more fun than i thought it would be
Did you meet anyone
Who was the fastest
Very fun speed dating night with klopf
I had to explain to everyone at speed dating that i wrote straightish because i wouldnt go to a thing like that to meet men
Some people drove three hours to do  minutes
So today there were  comics and everyone got  minutes
The mic in Charlottesville does this crazy thing where instead of capping sign ups they adjust the amount of time everyone gets
Put him in here
And found out he works at the winery Im starting work at on Wednesday 
Just got unsolicited advice from an unfunny dude at an open mic 
We both cumd
Me and cam went speed dating
that place was special
thats how i feel about it
Frankly I can drive just fine as long as I dont get caught
Its only come up once in like  years for me
Ok thank you thats huge
The cycle continues
Lmao it was the previous tenant
when I was living there we actually did get a rock thrown through our window 
Rock window
and not a door I can directly knock on
theres not a doorbell for that apartment
Ring door
Imo just go to old address in person
but like I literally sent a letter to my old address and tried getting in touch with my old landlord and have heard nothing so I think o have to just declare it loststolen
I tried to renew via the kiosk and they sent that one to the wrong address and I havent been able to get in touch with the people who live there now and the woman at the dmv right now kept being like I cant issue you a new ID you need to go claim the ID because your identity is floating around and someone could take that ID and throw it in a crime scene then theyd blame you for the crime
THE WORLD IS RUN BY LANDLORDS AND FOSSIL FUELS LIBS 
Chat thought they could just ride bikes the rest of their lives
Looooool
I am currently in drivers license bureaucracy hell right now so this is close to mind 
they release the appointments at am everyday so you have to wake up early to book
Might have been because PA doesnt make you take drivers ed
I had to take a written test when moved from PA to get an IL license
If you just have a state ID and not a license
Looooool you might have to do a road test
God Im just imagining the child like falling off the foot thing and flailing around
Thats so funny
Hahahahahaha
cant stop cracking up at this
Or Im sure someone on reddit has had the same problem
Give a call and explain ur situation and ask what all will be needed from you
Ok yeah IDK how that all is gonna work out
Whats the matter with you
U just have an IL ID
Ive never had a license in Illinois
I think u can do online if ur at the same address as your prior license
Personally it would be very convenient if I could just grab one next week
Politically i think drivers test should be stringent bc we dont do enough to recognize that these things are death machines that cause millions of deaths every year
But everything online is just if youre over  just show up and pay 
I think they just check youre vision
I havent had to do a road test since ever
I surrendered my Wisconsin license five years ago to get an IL ID so Im like wont I have to do a road test again
I dont think it took me more than an hour overall besides traveling there and back but its hard to say bc I also got lunch after
Show up with proof of residency and whatever else Id you need
Go to the one in Chinatown on a weekday before noon
I think when I converted to MN to Illinois I just walked up too
I had to renew mine bc of an address change and I just went
No
Do u have an il license already
Did you have to take tests
All the Chicago places say no available appointments so Im like do I just walk in with all the ids like lemme drive a car
Gotta use crypto forms and lib bucks to fill out your government freedom form
Were in the future now
Sorry boomer
When we went home earlier this year Rebeccas dad was annoyed that this government agency he was working with wouldnt take a physically mailed in form
Its sick
Everything is like online now
Honestly navigating government bureaucracy has never felt easier
After I showed two forms or whatever
I think you have to make an appt now but when I did it I walked in and they were like here you go
Yeah I have
Hey next Monday is Karis bday and she is having a lil get together at small bar at pm if anyone will be free and wanna meet up

Then for reality below deck med healed me post breakup
also im on kms avenue
Also only murders in the building is good sick day vibes
I Said it privately but bad sisters is very good
Just objectively not good jokes
Its tough when you know the jokes are bad
Man I couldnt last even like a minute in
Theyre all just so selfish and petty it rocks
its literally what if West Wing was good
Sorkin could never
I like how only some of the characters are actually clever and most are just dumb
that was a huge relief
will update my veep journey
im so glad we figured out what im watching tho thanks guys
Some of the richard splett stuff of the funniest shit Ive ever seen on tv
this is my new binge
I think the finale is my favorite tv episode
Its SOOOO good
Veep is so rewatchable bc I never remember all the mean little things they say so they always catch me by surprise
Jesus Christ this is from when I like just moved to Chicago
also girl ofc ive seen salt lake city
Like its fictionalized but it is based on somewhat real things that go on
Penn State has literally been taken over by high rise buildings its insane

no ill take another whack i guess
But hey if you dont like it you dont like it
""

Its kind of jarring at first but you gotta power through it
idk just spitballing
maybe you are small minded and weak
ok why cant i get into it
like i want to feel like im thinking
Well have you watched succession yet Ive been thinking of running through that again
Oh nvm

It is good
Otherwise the only things I ever watch are star trek and sopranos lol
no i want something thats like Good
Real life Truman show
Great british bake off is good for turning off your brain too
Secret lives of Mormon wives also very good
Honestly if you want to just completely rot and binge something insane real housewives of salt lake is pretty wild if you can stomach it
joey

u have to watch white lotus
Oh white lotus slaps
The contestant on Hulu
so that the next time Im sick I can finally start white lotus or whatever

jesus christ thats bleak
Those kids will look back in  years and be proud that they stood for something
Like just imagine for one second we live in that world
Can you imagine if the they sent in the national guard in to beat the fuck out of these kids for doing this like they did for the free palestine kids at Columbia
I had to file medical paperwork so I can be visibly depressed at work without being reprimanded
i had to babysit a DJ that was in a k hole during my brunch shift at stay cafe
yeah havent u done weird shit for trader joes
Yeah I guess
having extreme existential dread
I just dont think I can hide my contempt for an hour
Its pretty legal to make your employees do a bunch of weird stuff
he  voted for Trump
the day after the election he came into the office and sang  little birds to everyone
Neither of those are fair to ask
How is this even legal Im not trying to do a bit

Thank you
That is a consolation
Well if its any consolation I just applied to a Christian tech start up who are working on a new prayerspirituality app
Ive just kinda learned how to skim
i dont get how people handle the machete chris responses i would kms
like ive been avoiding ever asking to do  a show for  years now
i just dont have enough good mental health to submit to stuff in general hahaha
So even if u dont get booked right away it would get you in the process to get booked v quickly
Seems like he sends that as a default but then books those people before you know it
but i am gonna just bite the bullett and submit today
i am so scared to submit to paper machete bc idk if my brain can take a novel response to why its just not the right time for me
Yeah he keeps talking about it Im gonna ignore
Like that feels like something micropeens get off on
I honestly think he only responded because he wanted you to ask to see it
Yeah im gonna get called a micropenis hating bitch
When can we have a pergola party
"Itll be like
Hey 
Hey
I knew u were a bitch
Hey"
This is the kind of dude that will call you a bitch when you stop responding

But pls do not come until 
 w Logan Blvd
Whats your address again Ian
Hmmm 
I have a theory that my dick gonna merge in ur mouth
Only to start the cycle all over again
I have a theory that group chats expand continuously until they merge into one super massive group chat consuming all other groups chats and spinning wildly out of control until it disperses scattering its members into incalculable other smaller groups chats
""
I love it
good job aaron
wait this post in general is so insane hahaha
Leave it
Should I delete
Otherwise I yield to him
If theres enough for me and Joey
Ty
Yeah
Men be like astrology is gay then post memes like this about their groupchats
Ill bring some theyre in chocolate form
Skipping my birthday for Megalopolis round 
Can I also drink
Yeah
I mean
Im not drinking currently but does anyone want to do shrooms with me tonight
The center is asmus
The circles are group chats
Ikagi
Chicago comedy
Jack rocks
My king of kings
It was like hey sick to see you And then kinda fizzled
i dont know what i did before this group chat
Andrew and I ran into Jack at a show here
Because he showed me a meme Jack made about Laughable News
Im guessing Ricardo too
I think Knute is in the Jack Allen one
Life is so beautiful Everyone has their little group chats
Wait who is in that one
One time Jack Allen was telling me about his group chat and I was just like I cant imagine
A sit down with the five families
Theres probably like  group chats and Laughable News is getting posted in all of them
Yalta Confrence of Chicago comedy
You cant ban queer joy thats what I always say
thats for the queer chat
my queer joy is none of ur business
Coward
Well they have the signs up there to say not to do that
u know what im gonna delete that one
Hahahahahahahah
Hahahaha
hate that place
Green eyes
Drink a cold one at the bowling alley in a Jersey
asmus
where do danny and i go for a nice cold one rn
His name is Geoff Asmus
Sure they do
they dont have a chat baby either
sorry im drinking a beer
I dont think their chat plans hangs
should i wear a jersey or a white sox shirt to go bowling
Sorry Ive had  beer
RESPECTFULLY
Thats the clear rd
Ive been saying basketball game
so i think we should have a chat conference party
and then colin ungers chat also has the same people they shit talk
What can I say I love to bet on the ponies
yes we did go over all the same people we shit talk
Im in both chats and we make fun of the exact same people in both but the other one talks about gambling more
horrible ratio i had to send them an excel spreadsheet with all the women they could add in
Yeah whats the gender ratio in the main chat 
That being said Happy birthday to Mitchell 
And I love Hunter but of course he wants an all male chat
Youre our Snowden
devastating
and hunter went to shanker oh damn dude ur in THE MAIN chat
and shanker named off everyone in his
and i named off everyone in this one
was w hunter hirsch and max shanker last night and we were talking about our respective group chats
HAPPY BDAY MITCHELL
Im sure theyll have the main fight going on on the first floor
Well how about if anyone wants to have a beer before Mitchs and watch some amateur boxing fights  theyre welcome to come over around  and then we can carpool over to schubas around 
Damn
That would be my guess  fights that start at  pm Not sure how long those first three will go but Ive gotta assume at least an hour
Well thats gonna cut into our beautiful Mitchell time
 eastern
So the Tyson Paul fight probably wont go on until like 
Ya I wanna try to quick go to the gym before how about folks start showing up around ish
Of da Paul Tyson rounds
Could at least watch a couple rounds
If Jake Paul wins Im burning the pergola down
Also I think I can have a few folks over before Mitchs to watch the fight just react to this if you wanna come over before
It was nice seeing u at schubas I hope u have a great night
Yoo happy birthday Mitchell
I just want to reiterate happy birthday Mitchell Potts
Think like when SpongeBob faced off with King Neptune on cooking burgers but take out the spatulas and theyre touching
Unfortunately I only know how to explain this competition in terms of hamburgers
Im not sure
So its like Joey Chesnut vs Kobayashi but instead of hot dogs its punches
Its gonna be a Dave chappelle special
Which I feel is a big get
Its actually on Netflix
Blood sports are always pulling that shit
Is the fight not pay per view
Ya lemme circle back later I wanna run it by Kari otherwise we can meet at a bar or something
Your place
Wanna watch with your cats
Wait you prob miss your cats
Crowds suck tho
Johns place it is
It also might make sense to go to a bar close to schubas I feel like theyll drag the fight out with preliminarily fights
Aarons place is further from schubas than your place Ian
Lemme circle back closer to game time
Wicker
Wheres ur place with respect to schubas
We can also go to a bar or something nearby schubas thats playing it
My place or ur place Ian Erickson
Share if u agree
Very disappointed
I cant go to Mitchells tonight though unfortunately Im going to a surprise party for Julia
Maybe yeah
Oh maan
Anyone wanna pregame Mitchs and watch the Paul  Tyson fight
Thank you guys
Happy birthday Mitchell
We love Mitchie  Happy birthday Mitchie 
Oh hell yeah Cant wait to see everyone Gonna be a fun night
Happy birthday mitchie See ya at schubas
Oh hell yeah
I cant wait to go to Schubas to celebrate with all my friends
Thank you

Then she told me to be a man and stand on my own feet and I got to say I cant Im on crutches
A tenant who is pretty insane that screams every time she comes into our office was like they cant fire you why are you scared of them When I told her I wouldnt do something for her and I had to be like absolutely they can

But dumb as dirt
My neighbors dad loved me because I was big I was like Sam
Never was me

I still remember my friends mom being audibly shocked when she found out I had the best grades in my class in middle school
His answering machine bit was crushing last night
Me and stock well keep doing the fresh faces show together

The cats favorite food is pasta
Kid I volunteer with drew me this
A kid got in trouble during a fire drill today because he kept screaming that he was being kidnapped and a woman across the street waiting for the bus started filming lol
so weirdly it was news
it wasnt laughable but I genuinely did learn something from the Uranus video
Thanks Brian
I still need to watch that one
just him pronouncing Uranus not a joke in sight

Ian after returning from Japan
followed through on this
can we protest with FREE ZAKO signs
I was GLUED to my phone
it was probably my fav day in the group chat
Laugh all you want before I die Im getting an EGGOT
i wanna go this year
Everyone is right though
And that was one of the funniest things Ive ever seen
Ill always have a soft spot for the Gazellies because it gave the world the ZakoMack fight
i cant believe we have gun and gazelle also has fun
Its astonishing how many comedians cant understand joking
Sort of a who is this for Kinda thing
Gazelles are very similar to when a college theatre department does its own award show
maybe we will be ok
i did find out all of the people we shit talk in this group chat are also mentioned in another group chat
EXACTLY
people always jump to the defense of jerry and the gazelle bc theyre putting on good shows or whatever but its like cant a guy just make fun of someone for doing something dweeby anymore
yes
This would be so funny
Lets give Blake burkhardt rookie of the year
Is there not a cunty award this year
We can all put you for Most Improved
Or is that a bit that can only result in me having to go to the Gazellies
Should I campaign super hard for a Gazellie
""
Ians BACK
aaron  likes klopfer set the nickname for Kristi Durkin to didnt mean to change name sry
Japan was great but its good to be home
aaron  likes klopfer set the nickname for Kristi Durkin to sasa
Could we all hold hands there
Im being sober and that sounds like the perfect environment
wait we should make a good form to attend a bender
hahahahHA
We could do a chat trip to go see them every single night
its kinda cool in the sense thats its like tour but every night u get to go home to ur gf kristi
I wouldnt do it unless it paid enough to take more than a month off
im like feeling happy but conflicted about it for him lol
no days off
Might genuinely cause an injury
It would definitely be kind of cool to get that many reps in but no breaks at all is nuts
Wait like no days off
but its like theres never a Good month to do a show everyday i guess
the drama is that we were gonna go on a family trip and i was gonna film my special the month they asked
hAHAHA
wait i just got booked on some barstool show
Honestly could be an incredible creative process
Yeah there is no parking or bike parking over there That is an insane offer in general Liars Club is the new Vegas
That feels like durational performance art
and i dont fuck w the regulars but i do like the venue
Its really in a fucked up random part of Fullerton theres like nothing around it for two blocks
they have weird regulars
its like i like it but im like jesus everyday at liars club sounds like a lot
Man Ive always wanted to see what that place is like on the inside Ive gone by it so many times
its ALWAYS like that
lol phylyzzz just got asked to do a month long residency for liars club where they would play everyday for  days
Couldnt find my cat for like  mins and was frantically searching around having a minor panic attack and then when I finally found her under the couch she was looking at me like this
EXACTLY
I never hear of these guys until theyre the most influential thing on the internet
also i think i dont realize how big he is bc i never really looked him up bc the vibe seemed off
idk i totally agree it sucks but im like god damn i have to book people every week and now i have assassinate kill tony
a cumtown residency is a cumtown residency
Humiliating
Like imagine liking the president
Last thought is that they feed off of feeling like theyre edgy and counter cultural but guess what trump won the popular vote thats your guy
if this is your attempt to get crushes to stop booking nick mullen it will not work
If you could go back in time would you kill baby Bob keen
Exactly Im saving their lives
What are you stopping them from doing Most of the Kill Tony heads are dogshit at comedy and dont do anything besides the worst open mics imaginable
When actually its so lame
I just think you run the risk of making it seem cool
The next Rogan will be Shanklands fault
I cant stop joe Rogan but Ive met a lot of guys that I probably could have
I just think about the open micers that are like oh I like kill tony and maybe I could have done a better job explaining why I think its bad to them
I think at a local level its important to call out people when they buy into that shit and not fuck w them
I think you need to mock them more than anything
THANK YOU
I do think Bruce is right tho
Yeah and I think the new ones are going to be floating around the orbit if what already exists
Those guys are too big to stop but there are new ones started every day
Obviously Im thinking beyond what reality is right now but Im trying to think what are the steps we can take
Because younger comedians arent going to see these platforms as a route to success if using kill Tony as a credit can get you blacklisted
Instead we should say Joe Rogan makes a quarter million from Spotify and makes consequential presidential endorsements so he doesnt get to do the Im just a stoner idiot dont listen to me act
Im thinking live standup yeah
I mean yeah if youre talking live standup but that isnt really the problem imo
If clubs and producers stopped booking them
I think the approach is to treat them the way they treat mainstream press
What are you gonna exclude them from were talking about the biggest podcasts in the world by far
Yeah its a real problem Especially on twitter where people will retweet anything they hate to be like this is bad and end up just giving people a bigger platform and help them gain an audience
They are the platforms
No were past that point
Like people are always saying they suck but I think there probably needs to be more of an effort to not platform these kinds of people and the people that support them
And the Joe Rogans etc etc
Im reading the antifa handbook and Im starting to think maybe we arent harsh enough when we talk about the kill Tonys and legions of skanks of the world
johncrete what movie did you see
the way im so there
I love a beautiful birthday
exactly
Its actually so important to remember that mitchell is having a bday party at schubas on this upcoming friday  were all invited
This poll is no longer available
Whoa

You dont bring that up nearly enough
When I was Val Kilmers assistant he was doing a one man show and the other assistant had to be the audience plant for every show
Right now Nick Fuentes could be listening to boygenius and wed all be at brunch
Shankland doing what Kanye couldnt
You could have instilled in him a love of music
Just audience plants
He graduated the year before I got there but I would have had him
Nick Fuentes was a student at the school I student taught at
Hes been around he was on Kanyes campaign staff
And it turns out he lives in his mothers basement in berwyn
A far right dickhead made a video gloating about women losing rights
Has anyone seen the nick Fuentes stuff
Burn
My mom
Does anyone know about plants

Bail
Dude yeah fuck that
For how it is in general i feel like it has the most touristy crowds out of the clubs
Oof thats creepy
Theyve asked me out line three times
Also honestly Im  sure the person that booked me only booked me because theyre trying to sleep with me
I dont care if I bomb
I mean in the sense that management is awful
Also who knows maybe it got better
You cant protect yourself from everything and still learn lessons
I say experience it and decide
I got booked on a show there tomorrow and Im trying to decide if I should bail
You guys how bad is comedy bar
You should it was an awesome idea
no worries
Anyone wanna go dancing Saturday btw
Its such a fun kinda show to produce
Hollywood Illinois
When I get back from Japan Im starting my video show again

I left a little after it bc was tired from driving but good vibes
Kinda insane how good Clares video was
Suckn my own dick at midnight
it was starting to feel too much like lolla
I think its canceled because I dont think anything good is going to happen again
Just perfectly in the way
Those dumb vip booths wrecked the vibe
and also the lineup this year was lame
honestly pitchfork has gotten to be too much
In their reviews
Pitchfork is about to start using the r word
I just think thats an attempt to soften the blow
watch them move it to austin
yeah and saying we will not stop hosting events
I just feel like its so specifically like were not doing it in Chicago and we have made the difficult decision not to host Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago sounds like its gonna be somewhere else
Like I dont think moving it to Gary Indiana or whatever would make it more profitable
Yeah youre probably right
I dont interpret that as were going to have it somewhere else
I mean theres European pfk fests that are wayy smaller which is maybe what they mean by continue to produce events
Yeah its GQs fault gays and queers
Whoa whoa whoa lets not go that far
wait thats so gay
Man fuck GQ
Looks like it might just be moving cities which is DUMB
What
Pitchfork fest done for good 
and i just am like man maybe just close friends at lake house would be so sweetie
i feel like every year i try to either throw or go to a massive house party

My favorite part of eat pray love is when she spies on her neighbors
Klopfer you should buy a bunch of vape cartridges for  and then resell them to your Trader Joes coworkers for  a pop
Eating fudge praying no one sees your motel telescope and loving every minute of it
Building a telescope in a motel room feels so wrong

Truly one of the funniest things Ive ever seen
Sam when you played soccer and fell only to somersault and spring back on your feet
im sure theyre friends but it is truly so funny to hear geoff asmus get name dropped while im waiting on a line cook to drop a rueben
he keeps talking to the  year old food runner about asmus
Hahahahahaha
hahahahaahahahahahahahaha
He played soccer with us once and he got a yellow card because he purposely slide tackled someone and in the  seasons Id played no one had even gotten carded
Hey Joey I think this was a good riff that people didnt respect enough
Gonna get him pregnant some day God willing
I love that bitch
She had been on my show like two weeks prior
One time in that side area at LF tiny was giving comics hugs next to me and I thought she said hi to me so I gave her a hug too and then she goes are you a comic or something
I went to high school w a guy named Tiny Thickemz Think hes in real estate in West Allis now

Everyone was talking about big game
Then its basketball season

Unfortunately it seems so
Is basketball season over
Would anyone be interested in a diner breakfast tomorrow
Im gonna have another Christmas party gang Trying to decide on a date heart this for  and thumbs up for

LOL
CJ is popular on twitter and has some writing credits now I think
Cj is a good comic that used to live here
Jamie masada is the founder of laugh factory like above curtis
Why does anyone try to put their finger on the scale
Also I dont understand shit like this lol
Who is Jamie Masada and CJ Toledano
I guess its not great tea but jamie masada really wants chris bader to be a thing
Way back in the day when cj toledano lived here jamie masada tried to get cj to write jokes for chris
A little tea i know about chris
Really
I have never seen that dude show up for a spot Hes on so many posters and then just doesnt go
At least a once a week performer at LF
Hes like the kind of dude laugh factory books CONSTANTLY
Me Im more of a guy on  shows type of guy
Oh gotcha
Kind of a laugh factory Zanies comedy bar and road guy
Ive never heard of that guy is he never Or just like a laugh factory guy

UGH MAKE LANDLORDS GREAT AGAIN

Trump is gonna make it illegal to be mean to landlords
What Im really worried about too with trump being elected is that mortgage rates will go up and I wont be able to refinance by May like I wanted
The cost of shit has being going up a lot
I may even have to increase rent if I cant refinance this year
Honestly probs not

But I know its there to heal me
Man pulling a scab off is so satisfying
Might try yoga w Adrienne now this bitch sounds cool

Nice
hes shooting his own short
Plester
and i had to be like hey thats sick but i want actual good footage girl what r u doin
my producer is like cool but too cool and thinks we can film this on only a camcorder
im scared
hahahaahhaahahah
I thiiiiink I know how hell film itbegrudgingly 
ooooo good idea
Tbh Derek
on a handheld preferably
who would yall recommend for a person to film a show
he opened up his set last night being like i lost a bet if trump won i would have ti get into ventriloquism
The last time I saw him rap at Coles it made me laugh so hard
does anyone have his number
He fucking rules
its okay when i do it
Now that Kristi is the host I realize that its actually a very just system
I thought the bumping at Coles was so unfair when I first started here
hes getting into ventriloquism
haahahHAH i love him so much
Erik West would get vouched so hard
Three months in youre already addicted to this bs
what is coles if i cant let joey walk in and do a set
all i do is bump
Erik West can be the one guy you bump in
and its like no bumping
thats so true
I think the pm crowd is probably exactly the group that is monitoring the vouch shows
hahaHAHA
how will erik west find out he doesnt have a computer
But the mic was a pretty decent vibe
Well the word would spread
idk
yeah like is it fair to throw this new format in for the people who come every week at like  pm and wait
Didnt mean to send that
""
Yeah I will say when I did the one at Lotties there werent very many Coles regulars
i dont want to screw over our regulars
yes but just coles style dont be a weirdo and change our format
maybe ill tell them yet but no lotto
yeah also i dont want to do lotto
Yeah its a lotto of  people upton
And a different sign up process I guess since I think they do lotto
Itll just be a different  open micers
its def not gonna like help coles
and yeah sometimes nights at coles are slow but idgaf its mainly  comics every week and a really long gig
no literally i get the same paycheck so idc
Frankly all youre signing up for is a longer night of hosting Youre doing him the favor
but when my friends get it thats fun no shade
Yeah if its we need to now now then the answer is no
and gay even
but its coming off not cool
ultimately i think its a good idea for the scene
EXACTLY
CYSK speedrun
Going in with that attitude of you should be honored to be asked and dont expect me to be organized or respectful of your time is just replicating the rotten culture
Idk I can see the value in something like that conceptually but it only works if you have some humility
That makes it easy imo
and he was like well no its important i go home tonight with an answer
but yeah really up to you guys
and i was like hey you never reached out to me i need a second
I feel like honestly theres plenty of slow nights at coles anyway so it wouldnt hurt to make one of em for vouch
yes
Wait this was in person
idc that much i dont like that he was like cornering me as i was trying to set up saying he needed to know Now
i personally dont see it at coles but idc too much
Will doing it at coles just alienate the audience of normal attendees that already come on a regular basis
does coles benefit
My only thought on them asking to do it at coles is why coles
I think thats just the only way to present it
Even if theyre fuckin dorks about it being like an honor or some shit
Consider the way that organizations raise money for specific causes People always make the argument of like people will donate to the cause anyway but I think ultimately formalizing the process and stirring up publicity results in a more accountable experience and forces the process of bookers booking people
i think the purpose to get people booked is genuinely good but this process is a little redundant and a jack off no
to do other shows
and then the show is an audition
So thats how it works logistically
I did one of the mics and basically they just draw  people at the beginning of the mic to do  minutes as an audition for the show
like why doesnt chris trani just come see an open mic and ask people himself
it seems a little self important
I do think what theyre doing is a genuinely positive move for the community though
he didnt like that i didnt know him
Brandon is a sloppy person
lol
and i was like ahhhh what hahaha
and hes like well we need to know Now
brandon was like hey victoria hasnt responded to me so i showed up where is she and i was like shes in madison
they asked to do coles and idk if i like their vibe
ok ill bite whats the deal w vouch
i dont girl im sorry

CHAOS BRINGS THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER
Feeling amazing running into John stockwell tonight in the middle of the street in front of his house because somebody was drunk driving  and rammed their car into a bunch of cars on his street like  minutes before Derek and I biked by from a late showing of smile  where we got way too drunk and way too scared and thought we were still in the movie a little bit
Explain
yeah basically
hows morale
not bad tbh
Is he the new moral center of Coles open mic How are the vibes there
i like christian royce now
Kristi is saving the world rn
Yeah I immediately regretted that as soon as I sent it
and this is what I come back to
I go to Japan for TWO WEEKS
Please Ian I know times are difficult but we cant blame Japanese beetlejuice
I cant help but feel Japanese Beatlejuice shoulders some blame here
When we needed you the most you went to Super Mario World
Its a shame America cant hear poopfucker tonight
Gonna figure out the joke that will fix America on the way
Gonna head up to Coles in a few
Are you in touch with IWW
In a groupchat with workers who wanna unionize but our store hasnt yet
Is there a union person you can talk to
I dont know how to explain it its so convoluted and fucked
The hours I needed to go towards my adafmla thing were cut down because I was on leave of absence for injuries
Does this make sense
"So I was enrolled also in an ada thing did that so I couldnt get reprimanded for looking like Im not having fun at work

That gave me two call offs a month Those absences go towards insurance hours

I was banking on those to go towards my insurance qualification

Theyre just now telling me I havent worked enough to qualify for that kind of thing so I cant account for those absences"
Idk how fmla works but getting injured and taking a little off seems pretty obvious and standard right
Im ready
Need more incentive for a change
ugh dude im so sorry thats horrible
Losing my insurance in December bc I didnt work enough bc of my injuries 
Put a gun range in the pergola
Shooting a gun is like being bisexual you really need to try it every few years just to check and see if your taste has changed and you like it now
Shankland is political enough that Id consider going
Same
Fucked of you to say because I do have my rifle merit badge
bc youd be the first guy we all turn against
Yeah and Id go with him
Aarons friend isnt in the chat to be fair
Absolutely going nowhere near a gun range with anyone in this chat
ive shot rifles with my dad before
I love shooting guns
Just honked at a coworker for trying to be cutesy with me while I sit in my car for my break
""
He has a lot of guns and good vibes
He would be down
I have a buddy who is an ex marine
anyone going to this
That man looks like he owned guns off the record as well
Lmao Richies real estate developer good fella grandfather
Can I use this
Just found my grandpas gun license
Gun bad gun range fun
And when you hit the little can sitting on the fence Oh baby
Shooting a gun feels awesome tbh
No dog hate the dog is innocent
Also I used to work for West Virginias newest senator and I cant tell you how much I hate him and his dumbass dog
"chat trip to gun range 
"
You simply gotta try it
Its crazy some people in this chat havent shot a gun
If they dont pass they get sent to vibe camp
I would have a gun in a fun Charlies Angels kind of way
This country needs mandatory vibe checks
You pass the vibe check for one meg
idk I think Id be really good at gun
cant stop telling people about it
and unfortunatley it is the funniest thing ive ever read in my life
Some liberal white guy derek went to college with posted on facebook today that he wanted to learn how to shoot a gun because he was afraid for where the country was headed but a few weeks ago posted a  paragraph post about how being in las vegas was over stimulating
Good news Theyre sending the kid that bit me to a farm upstate with lots of space to run around with all the other kids that bit their teachers
There is still good in the world chat
Hahahaha
You think the uBreakiFix guys stole it
All my porn is gone tho
Got my phone fixed if you couldnt tell
There should be more imo
My own Twitter you might say
there are  people why not use it as a testing ground
A medium of my own creation
A writing exercise perhaps
This chat is simply a writing utility for my twisted little jokes
dont hide your light in the bushel of this chat
In this one rare instance John and I agree
Wanna host shit for dis cute little chat
We can also lip sync budd Dwyer etc
I have an amplified podium at my apartment if anyone wants to do a weird karaoke night
Coming from the chat heretic of course youd say that
I had strep the first time he won and now a knee injury Feels like this is my fault for not staying healthy
Nothing is sacred
I do this on almost a daily basis
Lol yeah well see not sure yet
I feel like most folks are tuned out of everything right now
I say post it if you feel like it
In a way the same thing
""
I see you as the chat grocery store owner
Im sort of a chat organizer
Chat is kind of the new community
Oh well then thats fine of course
But I did then use it and for that I apologize
